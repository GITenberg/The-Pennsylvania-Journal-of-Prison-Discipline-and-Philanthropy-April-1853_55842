   <span class="smcap">Art. I.</span>—MORAL AND RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF CONVICTS.
</h2>
<p class="p2">
   <span class="smcap">The</span> readers of this Journal need not
   be told that we are not very sanguine in our expectations of the
   permanent reformation of the mass of convicts. There are doubtless
   instances enough of success in such efforts to warrant and
   encourage them, and we are not to suppose that they are ever wholly
   useless. The true position for us to take is this. The earlier we
   address ourselves to the cultivation of right principles and habits
   in a human being, the more hopeful is the prospect of success; but
   there is a power in truth and love, which has not seldom overcome
   the most sturdy depravity; and while we have the precept and
   example of Him who “came not to call the righteous but sinners to
   repentance,” to prompt and stimulate our efforts in that direction,
   we have His promise too, that whatever is done in His name, and out
   of love to Him, shall in no wise lose its reward.
</p>
<p>
   It is under the influence of these views that we have looked with
   interest and anxiety to the religious and moral influences which
   enter into the discipline of our penitentiaries. To no section
   of their annual reports, do we turn with more eagerness than to
   that from the chaplain or moral instructor; and though now and
   then a well-digested and satisfactory account is furnished,<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">Page 54</a></span> we are
   often compelled to be content with very vague generalities. A
   specimen of the religious discourses addressed to these unhappy
   congregations; a true sketch of a dialogue on some religious or
   moral topic held with one of them in his cell; a synopsis of a
   month’s labors, showing the various methods employed, direct and
   incidental, to reach the sympathies, and awaken better motives
   and desires of the heart, or a brief analysis of those obstacles
   to moral and religious influences, which may be properly regarded
   as peculiar to prison life,—all these, or any of them would
   greatly relieve the monotony of the reports of chaplains and moral
   instructors, and would add materially to our means of judging of
   the fitness of their labors to the character and circumstances
   of those on whom they are bestowed. We are often favored with
   such specimens of the various methods in which instruction in
   secular knowledge is conveyed to the ignorant, and enabled to
   choose between them according to their apparent appropriateness.
   Why should not the like opportunity be afforded in respect to
   the more difficult and perplexing task of enlightening adult
   ignorance, counteracting deeply-depraved tendencies, and up-rooting
   established habits of evil?
</p>
<p>
   It was with the hope of bringing this important department of our
   penitentiary discipline more distinctly to view, and of making its
   principles more practical and definite, that the Prison Society
   recently took the subject up, and referred it to a committee for
   consideration and report.
</p>
<p>
   At the meeting in January last a full report was submitted, from
   which we make the following extracts:
</p>
<p>
   <span class="smcap">It</span> will be conceded on all hands, we
   presume, that moral instruction is an important element of every
   system of Prison Discipline. We are aware that in some of the
   largest prisons of Europe little, if any, importance is attached to
   it; but whenever there is any hope of reforming the character of
   a convict, or of establishing a permanent restraining principle,
   it must be founded on some improvement in his moral feelings and
   habits.
</p>
<p>
   That peculiar difficulties and embarrassments should attend any
   approach to this unhappy class of our fellow beings, with a view
   to mould moral character, would seem very natural; but is it not
   possible that we exaggerate the difference between them<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">Page 55</a></span> and the
   mass of the world, in respect to their susceptibilities of good
   impressions? May we not easily forget that between a score of men
   in our prison cells, and twenty score of men that may be selected
   from society at large, the only difference is that the former
   are detected rogues, and the latter are (perhaps greater) rogues
   undetected? The <em>ins</em> and the <em>outs</em> are equally open
   to moral influences, and yet we should be very likely to think of
   the <em>ins</em> as almost hopelessly beyond their reach, while the
   <em>outs</em> might be esteemed fair subjects of them.
</p>
<p>
   It is moreover surprising how much farther a conviction of crime
   goes to exclude men from the pale of sympathy and the offer of
   assistance, than crime itself. The guilt of hundreds of men at
   large is as fully established in the public mind, as that of any
   convict in our penitentiary; yet we do not regard it as at all
   impracticable to reach them with appropriate moral influences. We
   should not hesitate to commend books to their attention, to invite
   and urge them to attend some place of worship, nor to counsel them
   to abandon all evil courses. Why should we have less faith in the
   like means when employed upon no worse men, after their character
   has been defined by a judicial sentence? For though true it is that
   the presumption of innocence is only taken away by the proof of
   guilt, yet when looking at men as the subjects of moral influences
   and sympathies, the fact that one is in prison and another at large
   really makes much less difference than is generally supposed.
</p>
<p>
   Thus much it seemed needful to say, by way of answer to those who
   distrust all efforts for the reformation of convicts, regarding
   them as visionary, if not Quixotic. It is to be regretted that
   such incredulity sometimes possesses the minds of those who have
   the chief oversight and direction of the discipline of our penal
   institutions. The deception, hypocrisy and treachery of convicts,
   which they so often witness, naturally confirms their distrust and
   may very easily excite prejudices against any attempt to improve
   their moral condition.
</p>
<p>
   We are far from representing the moral and religious instruction of
   convicts as an easy task. It requires much patience, simplicity,
   tact and earnestness, a rare knowledge of human nature, and a
   combination of adjunct influences which are not always at command.
   We only mean to affirm that whatever<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_56">Page 56</a></span> force lies in the argument
   against efforts for the moral reformation of convicts, may be used
   against such efforts for any other class of men.
</p>

<p>
   It would be a happy thing for our prisons, if the spirit of
   Christian benevolence were sufficiently awakened and active to
   ensure the needful measure of sympathy, instruction and moral
   culture from voluntary and unpaid service. But necessity seems to
   be laid upon us to provide a more permanent and reliable system
   of agencies and influences. One or more officers appointed to
   this specific work of giving instruction to the ignorant, and
   presenting motives and encouragements to a better life to those who
   are accustomed to do evil, seems to be indispensable to secure any
   thing like a proper attention to this important department. Hence
   the call for a chaplain or moral instructor.
</p>
<p>
   In looking at the condition of our two Philadelphia prisons in
   respect to the provision for moral instruction, we are constrained
   to say, that it is not such either in efficiency or success, as
   we think desirable, attainable, and indeed absolutely necessary.
   Instead of bringing to view, however, what some of us might
   regard as grave defects in the present incumbents of the moral
   instructor’s office, we will suggest what we cannot but regard as
   indispensable requisites in such a functionary, and leave those
   who have the appointing and removing power to exercise it at their
   discretion.
</p>
<p>
   I. <em>A moral instructor should exemplify in the minutest
   particulars the moral principles he inculcates.</em>—Any
   obvious neglect or evasion of duty, any appearance of hypocrisy
   or inconsistency, any sallies of ill-humour or fretfulness, any
   impatience of contradiction and unteachableness in his pupils, the
   most trivial breach of promise, or in a word, any departure from an
   upright, open and ingenuous deportment, will detract sensibly from
   his power to do good.
</p>
<p>
   II. <em>He should possess the faculty of adapting himself to
   the various characters and temperaments of convicts.</em>—We
   do not mean by this that he should have any other faculty than such
   as shrewd men of common sense ordinarily possess, and on which they
   depend for much of their success in business. But it is by no means
   a rare thing to find a prison chaplain, or<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_57">Page 57</a></span> moral instructor peculiarly
   deficient in this point, and there is nothing which is likely to
   strike the class of people with whom he has to deal more quickly or
   more unhappily than a weakness of this kind, especially in one who
   is set to be their teacher and guide.
</p>
<p>
   III. <em>In such an office, the motive of benevolence and
   sympathy should be seen to have the predominance over the motive
   of self-interest.</em>—The laborer in this department, as
   well as in all others, is worthy of his hire, but if those he would
   influence discover in the manner of doing his work, or in his
   general intercourse, that he acts the part of a mere functionary,
   having his beat like a police officer, and fulfilling an appointed
   task like a delver or ditcher, his usefulness will be greatly
   circumscribed. And this suggests
</p>
<p>
   IV. A fourth quality in a chaplain or moral instructor, viz.:
   <em>a warm, glowing, personal, enthusiastic sympathy with the
   population of the prison</em>.—He is a physician among a
   company of diseased and dying patients. They are bidden to look to
   him for direction and to confide in his prescriptions, (though not
   in his power or skill,) for a cure of their maladies. If he has
   felt in his own person the presence of the same disease, (though
   perhaps in a less offensive and aggravated form,) and has known
   the value of a remedy, he will not look with indifference on their
   symptoms, nor hear unmoved their sighs and groans. He will have a
   tear of sympathy for the suffering; a helping hand for the weak and
   trembling, and will deal honestly but gently with the impatient
   and froward. They are guilty, and is he without sin? They are
   suffering the penalty of a wholesome law, and what but an unseen
   hand has restrained him from violating it? While therefore, he
   sets before them, honestly and faithfully, the evil of their ways,
   he will give power and persuasiveness to his words by the tender
   and sympathizing tones in which they are uttered. While he points
   them to a merciful and faithful high priest that has past into the
   heavens, and ever lives to make intercession for guilty, penitent
   men, he shows that, like that same high priest, he is touched
   with the feeling of their infirmities and sympathizes in their
   bondage.
</p>
<p>
   V. A chaplain or moral instructor <em>should have good judgment in
   the selection of subjects of conversation and instruction,<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">Page 58</a></span> and in his
   methods of illustration</em>.—It is not unfrequently the case,
   that the most harsh and repulsive views of moral and religious
   truth are presented to those whose minds are already filled with
   prejudice and hostility, as if it were needful (as it is said to
   be in some bodily diseases) to make them worse before attempting
   to make them better. A man of ferocious temper is the last person
   to tame a wild beast; nor will a severe and offensive presentation
   of the most precious truth be likely to win an already alienated
   mind. To charge home their guilt on convicts, and make them feel
   that they have as good as they deserve, even if their situation
   were much worse than it is, will never pave the way for moral
   influences.
</p>
<p>
   It requires good judgment to select topics for the moral and
   religious instruction of convicts, and much skill and tact to
   illustrate them. A false position on a moral subject will be quite
   as likely to strike a congregation of rogues as a congregation
   of honest men; and it is wonderful how the faith of a disciple
   is weakened by a single material error in a teacher. The moral
   instructor of prisoners, having nothing to do with points of
   polemic theology or subtle casuistry, has a plain and easy path if
   he is only willing to keep it. The elementary truths of religion
   and morality, which lie within the comprehension alike of a child
   and of an angel, and which are recognized by all sober-minded men
   as the basis and stamina of all true moral reformation, are to be
   explained and enforced, and their influence in promoting happiness,
   respectability and prosperity in this life and in preparing us for
   the future, is to be clearly exhibited.
</p>
<p>
   In illustrating these truths, much depends on a seasonable
   reference to those things within the knowledge or present
   consciousness of the convicts. Incidents of daily
   observation—the familiar phenomena of nature, their own
   history in its social and moral relations, (with which the teacher
   is supposed to have made himself acquainted) will furnish topics
   appropriate in character and abundant in variety.
</p>
<p>
   VI. <em>It is very important that a moral instructor should possess
   the faculty of casual teaching.</em>—It is an easy thing to
   occupy ten or fifteen minutes in talking with a convict, but if he
   would leave something behind him for the man to ponder and reflect
   on when the cell-door closes again, the visitor or instructor<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">Page 59</a></span> must weigh
   well what he says, and seize the opportunity to drop a casual word
   of admonition, or encouragement, or intimidation, as the condition
   and habits of each individual may warrant.
</p>
<p>
   These casual suggestions often have far more weight than a studied
   sermon, or an elaborate and earnest exhortation. The methods of
   exerting an influence over others, and especially over thoughtless
   and perverse persons, would be much more appropriate and effective
   were they governed less by the teacher’s own state of mind, and
   more by the state of the mind which he wishes to change. Moral
   instructors of all grades are oftentimes in the dark respecting
   the mental condition and habits of their catechumens; and prison
   chaplains or instructors not unfrequently err in occupying so
   much of their interviews in expostulation, reproof and entreaty,
   as to leave no proper opportunity to hear, much less to draw out,
   an expression of the convict’s own feelings. In such a case their
   labors, however well meant, lose much of their value, and are
   sometimes worse than wasted.
</p>
<p>
   VII. <em>It is highly desirable that instruction in sound learning
   should be combined with instruction in religious and moral
   duties.</em>—He who opens our minds to the apprehension of
   new and valuable ideas, gains an important ascendancy over us. The
   labors of a faithful and skilful teacher are always remembered with
   gratitude. Now there are a thousand opportunities in the course of
   ordinary instruction, even in the simple branches of reading and
   writing, to throw out suggestions of duty and interest, which a
   watchful teacher will eagerly improve. In the setting of a copy,
   in the reading of a paragraph, and even in the spelling of a word,
   such an opportunity may present itself. Powerful and lasting
   associations are often established in this way. The familiar
   sentence—
</p>
<p class="handwriting">
   “Evil communications corrupt good manners,”
</p>
<p class="continued">
   which has for a century perhaps, been used as a copy in
   writing-schools and classes, and which was originally selected,
   probably, because there is so large a proportion of letters of
   the simplest formation, has doubtless been fixed in the minds of
   thousands by the use of it in such a connection. When it is<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">Page 60</a></span> remembered
   how transient, uncertain and unfavorable is the opportunity to
   impress at all the minds of convicts, we may well insist upon the
   strictest economy in the use of such as we have.
</p>
<p>
   VIII. As a library has become an almost indispensable appendage
   to our prisons, <em>the moral instructor should be competent,
   not only to select the most appropriate book for the use of the
   convicts, but also to distribute them with judgment when under his
   care</em>.—The most preposterous errors are often detected
   in some of our prisons on both these points. Where books are
   kindly given for such a purpose, reference is seldom had to the
   appropriateness of them. They are not wanted by the donor, and
   are therefore given to the prison. The moral instructor should
   be held responsible for every book that goes upon the shelves of
   the prison library, and he should be so familiar with the general
   character and design of each volume, as to determine as to its
   appropriateness to the condition, capacity and present habit of
   each prisoner’s mind.
</p>
<p>
   IX. <em>We are clear that the moral instructor should reside within
   the prison walls</em>, and be expected to have the same constancy
   in duties and responsibilities <em>as the warden</em>, or any other
   resident officer. There is no hour of the day in which he may
   not find or make an opportunity of doing good, and it is only by
   identifying himself with the daily routine of prison-duties, and
   with the interests of all concerned in their administration, that
   he can properly execute his work.
</p>
<p>
   X. <em>The character and position of the moral instructor should
   be such as to command the respect and confidence of the officers
   and inspectors.</em>—There is no such thing as hood-winking
   prisoners on such a subject as this. They soon discover how much
   respect the executive authorities feel for the man who is appointed
   to such an office, and it is vain to suppose their estimation
   of him by those within the cells will be any higher. The moral
   thermometer on the outside and the inside of the partition wall,
   will indicate a similar temperature on this, and on most other
   subjects. There are prison chaplains and moral instructors in the
   world, whose characters and opinions challenge the regard and
   respect not only of prison officers and visitors, but of the public
   at large; and such have uniformly exerted a<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_61">Page 61</a></span> most sensible and happy
   influence on the wretched congregations committed to their charge.
   If the moral instructors in our State and County prisons are of
   this stamp, we may well congratulate ourselves that so important a
   post is adequately filled. If they are not possessed, in some good
   degree, of the qualities which have been enumerated, the sooner
   they are removed the better shall we regard it for the prison and
   for the public, for we are clear that an incompetent incumbent of
   such an office is an instrument of more evil than good.

      MANAGEMENT OF THE CONVICT PRISONS AND DISPOSAL OF CONVICTS,
   </h2>
   <p class="chapheader">
      1851-2, with notes on the Construction of Prisons, Treatment and
      Disposal of Juvenile Offenders, &amp;c. By Lieutenant Colonel Jebb,
      Surveyor General of prisons of England, &amp;c., pp. 218, with numerous
      plates.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   <span class="smcap">This</span> document is dated in June last,
   and came to hand since our January number was issued. In a cursory
   reading of it, we have noted several points of general interest,
   and without attempting a classification of the topics, we will
   imagine our readers to be looking over our shoulder as we rapidly
  turn the leaves, making now and then a brief comment or two.
</p>
<p>
   In the ten prisons for separate confinement in England proper,
   there is room for 2,459 convicts, and 2,193 were in prison, leaving
   unoccupied accommodations for 266. In the three prisons for labor
   on the public works there were 1,931 confined, and only 17 more
   could have been received. In the hulks, there were 1,780 and only
   two vacancies; and in the Juvenile Prison at Parkhurst, there were
   577 tenants and 29 vacancies. The total convict population of the
   year was 9,033, and there were 355 more on hand December 31, 1851,
   than at the same date in the previous year. Of the whole number, 13
   were removed to Lunatic Asylums during the year, 147 were pardoned,
   (of whom 76 were on medical grounds,) and 111 died.
</p>
<p>
   In the report of the Millbank prison, we have an incidental
   testimony from the chaplain to the moral advantages of separation,
   which we think valuable.
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">Page 62</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      Of <em>moral improvement</em>, however, as regards the
      <em>many</em>, embracing change of principle and <em>real amendment
      of character</em>, he feels (he says) considerable diffidence.
      Bearing in mind the circumstances of the prison,—the period
      of separate confinement, rarely exceeding six months, being
      somewhat brief to be <em>permanently effective</em> for reformatory
      purposes—the danger of any good impressions made during that
      period (the seed-time of reformation) being effaced when prisoners
      are transferred to the <em>large rooms and general ward</em>, where
      the opportunity is withdrawn from those under incipient convictions
      of being ever <em>left alone with their conscience</em>, and
      the spiritual exercises of the more advanced in religion, both
      meditation and prayer, are subject to disturbance.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   If this opinion is the result of intelligent and long continued
   observation, (as we suppose it to be,) it is certainly
   very conclusive as to the value and indispensableness of
   convict-separation as a means of reform. The italic words are all
   found of the same character in the original document. They form,
   when read by themselves, a memorable sentence, and one which we
   respectfully commend to all those who stand in doubt on the subject.
</p>
<p>
   “Moral improvement or real amendment of character, to be
   permanently effective among the many, is not to be expected in
   large rooms and general wards. They require to be left alone with
   their conscience.”
</p>
<p>
   From <cite>Pentonville</cite>, we have a very favorable report,
   especially as it regards the health, physical and mental. Only
   two cases of insanity have occurred during the year among 561
   prisoners, and of these one had low intellectual development, which
   made him incapable of learning a trade; and the other, though only
   26 years of age, had been previously convicted and imprisoned three
   times. He was suddenly seized with mania three weeks only after
   commitment, and cerebral disease was presumed by the physician to
   have been upon him when received. Concerning both of the cases the
   physician remarks, that the “insanity was not traceable to the
   operation of separation on the minds of the prisoners.”—p. 11.
</p>
<p>
   We venture to say that no prison on any plan or system can show
   cleaner papers respecting the health of an equal number of convicts.
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">Page 63</a></p>

<p>
   It seems that immediately succeeding this year of remarkable
   health, in the course of the first half of the year 1852, “an
   unusually large number of cases of mental affection” occurred,
   which led to the substitution of brisk walking in concentric
   rings for exercise in separate airing yards—the abolition
   of the mask or peak which was found useless as a preventive of
   recognition, and the doing away of the chapel stalls. It is well
   known that these three features of the Pentonville system were
   designed to carry out the principle of strict separation. If
   they were found ineffectual for this purpose, their abandonment
   is a matter of no moment; and as the term of imprisonment in
   this penitentiary is regarded as probationary, and is moreover
   restricted to twelve months, we can scarcely suppose that such
   changes were required by way of relaxing the discipline. Colonel
   Jebb gives us to understand that the prejudices of the public
   against separate confinement are gradually subsiding, and he thinks
   it “of greater importance to the more general introduction of
   the system that every effort should be made to secure its great
   advantages without again raising the question of its safety.”
   Is there no danger, however, that its efficacy may be so far
   diminished by needless relaxation, as to make it scarcely worth the
   trouble of introducing it?
</p>
<p>
   We have not a shadow of evidence, nor even an intimation that
   the supposed increase of insanity was in the slightest degree
   the result of severe discipline; nor have we any report from the
   medical officer, visiting or resident, as to the existence of such
   “an unusually large number of cases of mental affection.” But
   whether they existed or not, “they were believed to exist,” and the
   Board of Commissioners directed the changes to which we have above
   adverted. In the progress of the inquiries on the subject, it was
   suggested to the visiting director, that he should obtain the joint
   opinion of the Governor, Chaplain and Medical Officer on sundry
   points, among which were the following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      1. Whether it appears necessary to reject any particular
      description of prisoners as being unfit subjects for separate
      confinement, such, for instance, as those of dull intellect, or
      others who do not speak the language, and are, therefore, less
      capable of instruction.
   </p>
</div>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">Page 64</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
  <p>
      2. Whether the arrangements at Wakefield and Leicester, with regard
      to assembling for public worship, school instruction, exercise
      in association, &amp;c., are likely to be the cause of a more
      favorable effect of separate (?) confinement on apparently the same
      class of prisoners.
   </p>
   <p>
      3. Whether a greater stimulus or a greater degree of vigor cannot
      be imparted to the trades and occupations in the cells.
   </p>
   <p>
      4. Whether it will be necessary and desirable, after a certain
      period of confinement, to exercise all prisoners in association,
      and whether the removal of both the long ranges of exercising-yards
      will be sufficient for such purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
      5. Whether the garden at the back of the prison might not be
      advantageously cultivated by prisoners selected from those who may
      have been a certain period in confinement.
   </p>
   <p>
      6. Whether dispensing with the mask would be likely to be attended
      with a beneficial effect.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   We should have been gratified to know the answers which were
   returned to these pertinent and important inquiries. We think
   the second question would puzzle the wisest commissioner that
   could be found, whether association will be the cause of a more
   favorable effect of separate confinement on apparently the same
   class of prisoners! Or to vary the phraseology, what is likely to
   be the effect of association upon separation! In the absence of
   any report from the medical officer, and with the health report
   of the preceding twelvemonth before us, we cannot doubt that some
   misapprehension has arisen from exaggerated and possibly fictitious
   representations.
</p>
<p>
    A new chapter of observations and conclusions is opened to us at
    Millbank by Dr. Baly, the visiting physician. It will be remembered
    that no little discrepancy of opinion occurred a short time since
    between the resident and visiting physician of the penitentiary
    at Pentonville,<a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1"
    class="fnanchor">A</a> and hence we should feel disposed to
    suspend full confidence in the present statement, till we know
    what the other doctor has to say. But one or two facts may be
    safely cited, which will serve to show how entirely irreconcilable
    some theories on this subject are with each other, and with the
    actual phenomena. Of eight insane convicts transferred during
    the year 1851 from Millbank to the Lunatic Hospital, five were
    decidedly insane when received into the prison. The aggregate of
    eight years gives us sixty-five cases<span class="pagenum"><a
    id="Page_65">Page 65</a></span> of insanity among 7,393
    convicts, of whom thirty-five were insane when received, and nine
    of the remainder were of very low intellect, and only twenty-one
    were of sound mind; of these twenty-one, thirteen recovered in
    the prison, leaving only eight all told, or about one in 1,000 as
    sufferers, in this form, from their incarceration! What prison or
    what mode of discipline can show a better result than this?

   </p>
</div>

<p>
   Among the very remarkable things disclosed in this report of Dr.
   Baly, we find that during the first four years of the period of
   time embraced in it, when the average term of imprisonment was
   less than one hundred days, the cases of insanity were 11 or 3.28
   per 1,000 prisoners, and that in the last four years, in which
   fifty-six days were added to the average length of confinement,
   the cases of insanity rose to 19 or 4.70 per 1,000! So that,
   omitting those who recovered in prison, the ratio in the first four
   years was 1.49 per 1,000, and, the last 2.72, or nearly double!
   It has been generally conceded even by the most zealous opponents
   of separation, that its tendencies are quite harmless and even
   wholesome, when not extended much beyond twelve months; but Dr.
   Baly’s report presents an entirely new view of the case. He tells
   us that the ratio of insanity is twice as high in the second three
   months of confinement, and more than three times as high in the
   third, as it is in the first. His table is as follows:

   But it unfortunately happens that the reasons assigned for these
   results would go to disprove them. “The various feelings<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">Page 66</a></span> of remorse,
   shame and despondency,” and the “withdrawal of the external sources
   of excitement,” would be much more likely to work upon convicts’
   spirits during the first three months, than during the third three
   months, especially when the termination of the sentence is so near
   at hand. But the whole statement is so extravagant, and so contrary
   to the received opinions of even anti-separatists themselves,
   that we are disposed to give it very little weight. Dr. Given,
   late resident physician of the Eastern State Penitentiary, whom
   we must all regard as at least an uncommitted party, expresses
   his conviction of the entire safety of separation for the term of
   twelve months, even in the case of minors; but beyond that, in
   their case, he would seldom extend it. See his Report for 1852.
</p>
<p>
   We have yet to be informed of the first case of the loss or
   serious impairment of a convict’s mental or bodily health from the
   judicious and faithful administration of the separate system of
   discipline; but whatever real or fancied dangers to body or mind
   attend it, one thing is made clear by the report before us, viz.,
   that it is wonderfully efficacious.
</p>
<p>
   We infer from several passages in this document, what we have not
   seen more specifically stated elsewhere, that “the principle of the
   discipline now established in the English prisons, contemplates a
   confinement of the convict in strict separation twelve months, to
   prepare him for a term of labor in association;” and this latter
   stage, from its “exposing prisoners to many temptations, which
   they would have to encounter on their final release from penal
   restrictions in England, is to prepare them for that event.” So
   that we have three grades or stages in the process; separation
   follows conviction and introduces to association, which is
   preparatory to transportation.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      The convict, having passed the appointed term in separate
      confinement, is removed to the establishment in Portland Island
      (or, it may be, when suitable arrangements are made, to one of our
      Dockyards), to labor in the formation of the harbor of refuge, or
      on some public work. There, although he is still under religious
      instruction and very judicious superintendence, his principles and
      the reality of his reformation are subjected to a severe test. He
      is associated with other convicts, and, as it cannot be supposed
      that all have been reclaimed, he meets with many temptations.
   </p>
</div>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">Page 67</a></p>

<p>The officer in charge of the Portland Island establishment, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      The subdued, improved, and disciplined state in which the convicts
      generally arrive at Portland, from the stage of separate
      confinement, appears to be an admirable preparative for their
      transfer to the greater degree of freedom unavoidable on public
      works. Those convicts who have been for a considerable time at
      Portland, have not usually indicated any falling off in morals or
      conduct, but, on the contrary, several instances have occurred in
      which men, on whose conduct the comparative degree of liberty here
      alluded to, appeared to have at first an unfavorable effect, have
      afterwards become orderly and industrious, and content to work
      their way cheerfully to the prospective advantages held out to
      convicts of that character.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   Such strong testimony to the efficiency and powerful reformatory
   influence of separation, is of great value.
</p>
<p>
   Some interesting items are furnished on the extent and expenses
   of transportation. The number of convicts sent to the Australian
   colonies from Great Britain in 1847, was 938, in 1851, 1568. The
   average number transported annually from Great Britain, is given at
   1750—1300 males, and 450 females.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      The estimates for 1852-53 for services connected with the
      transportation of convicts amount to the gross sum of 101,041<i>l</i>.,
      which provides for the removal of 3,100 males and 800 females from
      Great Britain and Ireland to Australia, and of 800 to Bermuda and
      Gibraltar.
   </p>
   <p>
      Deducting the probable expense devoted to the latter service, there
      might remain about 95,000<i>l</i>., as the amount required for the removal
      of 3,900 convicts, or 24<i>l</i>. per head.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   From various movements in the present parliament, we are led to
   infer that transportation will soon be abandoned. This event
   is more than intimated in the report before us. It is inferred
   from the tenor of a brief discussion of the scheme of the select
   committee of the House of Commons, announced two years since, in
   the form of three specific propositions, viz.:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      I. That after prisoners under long sentences have undergone a
      period of separate confinement, the remainder of their sentences
      ought to be passed under a system of combined labor, with effectual
      precautions against intercourse.
   </p>
   <p>
      II. That this object would be greatly facilitated
      by the erection<span class="pagenum"><a
      id="Page_68">Page 68</a></span> of district prisons, at the
      national cost, for the reception of prisoners under long sentences
      after they have undergone such previous separate confinement.
   </p>
   <p>
      III. That such district prisons should be maintained at the
      national cost, and the government of such prisons, and all
      appointments and salaries of officers, ought to be under the
      control of Her Majesty’s Government.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   Col. Jebb regards these plans with unqualified favor. “If it were
   only to avoid the inconvenience and expense of transportation,”
   he says, “it is well deserving of attention, especially in an
   economical point of view.”
</p>
<p>
   It seems that lengthened “periods of imprisonment have not hitherto
   been resorted to, partly from there being no existing prison
   where sentences exceeding twelve months could be properly carried
   into effect, and partly, from a sentence of transportation in
   former times affording so easy a solution of all difficulty both
   as regarded expense and final disposal.” And Col. Jebb expresses
   the opinion, that “if facilities existed for carrying into effect
   sentences of imprisonment extending from eighteen months to three
   years without expense to the counties and boroughs, a large
   proportion of the present sentences to seven years’ transportation
   would be changed to imprisonment.” Allowing the average sentences
   to be from two and a half to three years, nine months would be
   past under the discipline of separation, and from twenty-one to
   twenty-seven months in the district prison.
</p>
<p>
   As a general conclusion of the whole matter, Col. Jebb copies
   and adopts the opinion of the Parliamentary committee, that
   “if conducted under proper regulations and control, separate
   confinement is more efficient than any other system which has
   yet been tried, both in deterring from crime and in promoting
   reformation.”
</p>
<p>
   It is quite evident that he is no convert to Dr. Baly’s views, for
   he does not propose to reduce the average term of separation below
   nine months, within which all the mischiefs of it, (according to
   the Dr.’s theory or statement,) are experienced. Indeed, if we are
   not under great misapprehension, Col. Jebb has over and over again
   expressed his confidence in the principle<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_69">Page 69</a></span> of separation, when applied to
   periods varying from twelve to eighteen months.
</p>
<p>
   So far from yielding to a suggestion of relaxation, the present
   report urges <em>a uniform system of discipline</em> in all
   prisons, and the enforcing of separate confinement alike to the
   tried and the untried. It endorses the declaration of a committee
   of the House of Commons, that “the combination of hard labor
   with individual separation, has been remarkable in its effect to
   decrease the number of committals.” The prison of Leicester is
   cited as an example.
</p>
<p>
   In one section of the report, the subject of enforcing hard labor
   is discussed; Lord Denman’s remarks are cited, in which he speaks
   of “the only legitimate end of punishment being to deter from
   crime; but I think I perceive,” he says, “in some of the theories
   of benevolent men, such a mode of administering the criminal law as
   to encourage instead of deterring. I greatly dread the effect of
   giving convicts benefits and privileges which they never could have
   hoped for but from the commission of crime.”
</p>
<p>
   In allusion to this subject Col. Jebb, in his report for the
   preceding year, suggests whether among “the means of increasing the
   stringency of the discipline, and bringing it to bear with greater
   effect on the lowest class of prisoners, and on such as prove to
   be incorrigible, also on prisoners re-committed to prison, giving
   them a less comfortable bed for certain periods, or on alternate
   nights,—might not be desirable. The physical comforts of a
   prison are of necessity greater than the majority of prisoners
   enjoy when at liberty; and if, without injury to health, these
   can be abridged, a more deterring effect will be produced by
   the discipline, both on the individual himself and the criminal
   population generally.”
</p>
<p>
   We have often and earnestly contended for a more liberal use of
   those methods of discipline which apply to the sources or organs of
   criminal indulgence. Moral diseases have corresponding remedies. No
   more suitable remedy can be prescribed for idleness and indolence
   than hard work. Nothing is more irksome to a man given to depraved
   appetite, than short commons. The difference between a good dinner
   on corned beef and potatoes, and a ration of bread and water,
   is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">Page 70</a></span>
   felt at points which reproof and the shower-bath, and even the
   cat-o’-nine-tails, will none of them reach. The former, by itself,
   will subdue a spirit which the three latter combined will only
   rouse to indomitable stubbornness.
</p>
<p>
   On the whole, we regard this document as decidedly confirmatory
   of the views which have been uniformly advocated by the
   Philadelphia Society for the Alleviation of the Miseries of Public
   Prisons, and in the pages of this Journal. It contains not a
   statement nor a tittle of evidence that impairs in the slightest
   degree our confidence in the safety, efficacy and humanity of
   convict-separation. That it has been, and may be abused or
   ill-administered, and that it requires judgment and discrimination
   to adapt its provisions to the various classes of persons who
   are subjected to it, is not more true of this than it is of the
   gregarious or any other system. The only substantial fault that
   we have ever known to be found with it, is that it costs more
   than association, and the only answer to be made to this is, that
   (admitting the statement to be true) it is worth as much more as it
   costs.

      <span class="smcap">Art. III.</span>—SOURCES AND CHECKS OF
      JUVENILE DELINQUENCY.
   </h2>
</div>

<p>
   <span class="smcap">When</span> the farmer finds his fruit trees
   exposed to the ravages of the caterpillar, he makes but slow and
   unsatisfactory work, if he takes the worms one by one as they are
   feasting on the leaf, or crawling along the stem, or dangling in
   the air. There is a period of the day, however, when they are
   all in their nest, and if he can apply a torch to their curious
   fabric and consume it, or riddle it with shot, or wind it and its
   wriggling population upon a brush or broom well besmeared with
   pitch or tar, to be forthwith put into the fire or under the foot,
   the work is thorough and the tree safe.
</p>
<p>
   Not inaptly does this illustrate, or serve to point out the
   true process for the diminution of crime. The arrest, conviction
   and punishment of here and there a rogue, is scarcely felt. It
   is but a unit subtracted from the appalling aggregate of crime.
   If we would have the ratio of our criminal population<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">Page 71</a></span> palpably
   and permanently lessened, we must lay hold of the young ones in the
   nest, and whatever the trouble or cost, we may rest assured it is
   by all odds the cheapest and only effectual way of dealing with the
   pest.
</p>
<p>
   Among the prominent causes of, or excitements to a criminal
   life which are operative upon childhood, especially in cities and
   populous towns, have been reckoned 1, and chiefly drunkenness.
   2. The absence of education and industrial training. 3. The
   inadequacy of home-accommodation to secure the ordinary decencies
   of life. 4. The demoralizing influences of cheap theatres, and
   other low places of amusement, association with fire companies,
   and the liberty to dispose of the whole or a considerable portion
   of their own earnings. 5. The example, instruction or orders of
   parents constraining them to vicious acts, and 6, the connivance or
   co-operation of receivers of stolen goods to prompt them. We might
   indefinitely enlarge this catalogue, but these causes are adequate
   to account for the greater part of juvenile crime.
</p>
<p>
   The readers of our Journal cannot fail to be aware of the
   unusual interest which has recently been awakened on this subject.
   Our present number contains sundry evidences of it, and by
   referring to the cover, a notice will be found, the design of which
   is to provoke inquiry and discussion, with a view to reformatory
   measures. As human nature is substantially the same all the world
   over, and as like causes produce like effects, we have transferred
   to our pages several interesting and important passages from the
   last report of the inspector general of English prisons, bearing
   particularly on this subject.
</p>
<p>
   In respect to the first cause of juvenile depravity, which we
   just commented on, drunkenness—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      “Statistical returns show that the amount of money expended in
      intoxicating drinks of one kind or another in Great Britain,
      is between fifty and sixty millions of pounds sterling per
      annum,—a sum fully equal to the whole national revenue.
   </p>
   <p>
      “Now such an enormous expenditure on any one object must
      produce a noticeable effect upon our social condition. Were such
      a sum annually expended on the reclaiming of waste land and the
      improvement of what is but partially cultivated, and the erection
      of comfortable dwellings, in a few years our whole island would be
      a garden of beauty and fertility.
   </p>
</div>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">Page 72</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      “But what are the results produced?
   </p>
   <p>
      “The physicians of our lunatic asylums tell us that intemperance is
      the cause of a large proportion of the cases of insanity.
   </p>

   <p>
      “The medical officers of our infirmaries and dispensaries tell
      us that many diseases are caused, and more are made fatal, by
      habits of intemperance.
   </p>
   <p>
      “The masters of our poor houses tell us that they can trace the
      pauperism of most of their inmates to their own intemperance, or to
      that of their parents.
   </p>
   <p>
      “The governors and chaplains of our prisons tell us that most of
      the crime in our gaols is directly or indirectly caused by strong
      drink.
   </p>
   <p>
      “If the offences to which habitual drinking has ultimately led
      could be ascertained, I believe we should find that four-fifths of
      the recorded offences have sprung from it.”
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   Although the remedy for this enormous evil is justly regarded
   as lying to a considerable degree in the hands of educators, it is
   maintained that “much may be done to abate the evil by reducing the
   number of licensed public houses both in town and country, and by
   greatly raising the expense of strong drink.”
</p>
<p>
   As an evidence of the effects of cheapening strong drink, it
   is stated that in 1825, the duty on whiskey was greatly reduced
   in Scotland, and that as a consequence, intemperance began to
   increase, so that “in the twenty-seven years which have since
   elapsed, the consumption has become nearly <em>five-fold</em>
   greater; crime, disease, and death have increased in similar
   proportion; and the sober, religious Scotland of other days is now
   <em>proved</em>, by its consumption of spirits, to be, without
   exception, the most drunken nation in Europe.”
</p>
<p>
   As to the connection between intemperance and the other causes
   of juvenile depravity, “the records of the prison-house, if
   fully analyzed, would show that the <em>first penny or the first
   pound</em> taken by a son from his parents, or abstracted by the
   young man from his master’s desk, is for the theatre, not for
   the public-house. But youth, being corrupted by the pleasures
   of sin, drunkenness follows, and becomes the associate or the
   substitute of licentiousness, and completes the ruin. Money
   becomes indispensable, and it is gotten by some desperate and
   wicked means, at the possibility of which a few months before,
   the mind would have recoiled with indignation, like that of<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">Page 73</a></span> Hazael,
   when reproached by the prophet: ‘Is thy servant a dog, that he
   should do this great thing?’”
</p>
<p>
   In the great majority of instances, it is believed, the only
   means by which the reformation of such can be rationally expected
   is by their thorough and permanent severance from those scenes
   and associations in which their evil habits were formed. Although
   suffering from hunger and misery, it must not be supposed that the
   lives led by these delinquent children are void of pleasurable
   sensations; “the very alternation from one extreme to another keeps
   the mind in a state of feverish excitement; the want of a penny
   to buy food on one day, is more than compensated by the reckless
   profusion of the next; and the despondency created by privation and
   long suffering is speedily supplanted by exultation on the success
   of some criminal feat of daring and dexterity.”
</p>
<p>
   None will deny another position of the report, viz.:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      “That it is impossible for children to be brought up as
      Christian children ought to be, when huddled together, male and
      female, old and young, like pigs in a stye; and yet this revolting
      expression is not too strong to designate the dwellings of tens of
      thousands in our land.
   </p>
   <p>
      “How many of our honest industrious artisans have only one
      apartment, or, at most, a room and a closet for father and mother,
      and grown up sons and daughters!
   </p>
   <p>
      “The physical condition of the poor cannot be viewed as
      separated from the moral. The want of a proper dwelling place for
      the working man is one of his greatest trials, and is as injurious
      to his spiritual as to his bodily health. The crowding together
      of a whole family in one room weakens domestic virtue, destroys
      all self-respect, modesty, and delicacy of feeling, and utterly
      removes all opportunities for self-improvement. A home which is
      miserable from physical or moral causes is the half-way house to
      the gin-palace or beer-shop.”
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   The inquiry might be opportunely raised, whether the
   <em>habits</em> of life which constitute such a social state as
   is here described, are not formed long before the state itself
   is entered. A girl or boy accustomed to street-associations
   either in the pursuit of some trading employment, as selling
   papers, matches, &amp;c., &amp;c., or from mere neglect and
   idleness, will soon fall into habits which no degree of
   loathsome infamy or social degradation<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_74">Page 74</a></span> will shock. The origin of
   the evil, in such cases, lies far back of its present stage and
   locality. It dates from the <em>childhood</em> of those who now act
   as the head of this filthy and brutalized little community.
</p>
<p>
   Of the penny theatres, it is truly remarked, that “they present
   almost irresistible attractions;” and the annals of juvenile
   delinquents are full of cases of petty thefts committed in order to
   procure the penny or twopence required for admission.
</p>
<p>
   Even if the price of admission be honestly obtained, as one of
   the reports says, the scenes to which the youthful spectator is
   there introduced are understood to be of the most flagitious and
   depraving nature, calculated only to inflame the passions, and
   deaden every virtuous feeling.
</p>
<p>
   Singing-rooms and dancing-rooms, too, are represented as training
   up boys and girls to familiarity with vice in every shape. A
   magistrate sent two of his officers to visit one of them. Their
   report describes seven hundred boys and girls collected together to
   have their bodies poisoned with smoke and drink, and their minds
   with ribaldry and obscenity! Can any one have a doubt that the evil
   wrought in such a singing-room in a single night, outweighs all the
   good that can be effected by a dozen Sunday-schools in a whole year?
</p>
<p>
   And finally the part played by the receivers of stolen goods is
   described as a profession.
</p>
<p>
   So much for causes, and now as to remedies. These are
   emphatically <em>preventive</em> in their nature, “lying at
   the very foundation of our social arrangements, and until very
   recently, wholly disregarded and uncared for, viz., ‘organized and
   adequate means for <span class="smcap">education</span> and <span
   class="smcap">industrial training</span>.’”
</p>
<p>
   It is remarkable how many of the prominent features of some
   of our modern schemes of juvenile reform here, have been long
   ago presented to the public eye. More than half a century ago,
   (1796) the renowned Earl of Chatham introduced to the British
   Parliament a bill, which had for its object the establishment of
   a school for work in every parish or incorporated district, for
   the purpose of instructing the children in different trades and
   manufactures. The parishes were to be at liberty to maintain their
   poor children in the working schools, or to lodge them there or
   keep them only during the hours of labor,<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_75">Page 75</a></span> and then feed them there or
   give them work to do at home. The overseers were to be charged with
   the direction of these schools, and were required to supply them
   with materials and utensils, &amp;c. Parents burdened with infant
   children, and in the receipt of out-door relief, were required to
   send their children to the working school as soon as they were five
   years old, to be instructed and maintained there. It was provided
   that those fathers who might prefer to keep their children at home,
   should bring them up and employ them, receiving some direction
   and assistance from the local authorities until the children were
   in a condition to gain their livelihood. Upon leaving the working
   school, those children who could not return to their families
   were to have been apprenticed at the expense of the parishes, or
   provided with some means of service.
</p>
<p>
   It has long been our conviction, as the volumes of this Journal
   will show, that no very radical reform of the vicious children and
   youth of the land will be accomplished, so long as the government
   is so reluctant to enforce parental obligations, or to take upon
   itself all due attention to such obligations in those points where
   the welfare and safety of society are put in jeopardy by the
   disregard of them. Though our institutions are based on a principle
   of the utmost liberty, they are, for that very reason, peculiarly
   dependent on the proper education and training of children for
   their preservation. No country on the face of the globe has so much
   staked on the intelligence, industry and virtue of each succeeding
   generation as ours. We are fully satisfied that the timidity which
   our government manifests in laying fast and earnest hold of this
   great evil, <span class="smcap">parental neglect</span>, exposes us
   to the loss of all that is worth preserving.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      “Society has surely the right to guard itself against the evil
      practices of those neglected children; and, having the right, it
      ought also to have the power; but if such power exist, it seems
      very difficult to tell in whose hands it is vested. The child
      convicted of theft is whipped or imprisoned, but if he stole to
      appease the cravings of hunger which his worthless parent failed
      to satisfy, it is clear that chastisement has not fallen upon the
      proper party, and that the really guilty has profited by the vices
      prompted by his culpable neglect, while the whole cost has been
      defrayed by the public.”
   </p>
   <p>
      “Power must be given,” says our report, “to send to school <span
      class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">Page 76</a></span> all
      <em>neglected</em> children—all found loitering in streets and
      lanes—whose parents take no charge of them, but leave them to grow
      up as they may, untutored and untaught, save in the practice of
      crime. If the parents neglect to perform their bounden duty, then
      the State may properly step in, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">loco
      parentis</span>, and do the needful work; and surely this is no
      unjustifiable interference with the parental authority—it is only
      saying to the parent, ‘if you will not discharge the duty you owe
      to your child, both in the sight of God and of man, we, the public,
      will do it for you; we will not suffer your child to grow up a
      torment to himself and to all around him; we would much rather you
      did your duty yourself, but if you <em>will not</em>, then <em>we
      must</em>.’
   </p>
   <p>
      “By law, the burden of uncared-for pauper children falls at present
      on the workhouse, but the poor-law authorities are not entitled
      to expend their money, unless under their own immediate control;
      and power must be given to them to do so, through the medium of
      industrial school managers. This will be as advantageous as it is
      economical. Better for the public, who must eventually pay in one
      form or other, to maintain the child in an industrial school at
      4<i>l</i>. a year, than in a poor house at 10<i>l</i>. or 12<i>l</i>., especially as the
      smaller expenditure gives every prospect of making him a useful
      member of the community, and the larger gives little hope of ever
      raising him above the pauper class.
   </p>
   <p>
      “A good education,” says one of the inspectors of the English
      National Schools, “so infallibly dispauperises, and raises its
      recipient above the necessity of ever again applying for relief,
      that except under gross mismanagement of the guardians in other
      points, we may be tolerably certain that vicious habits, easily
      eradicable by sound early training, have brought the great
      majority of those who burden the parochial rates to their state
      of dependence. Could this truth be more universally impressed on
      the managers of the poor, the difficulties in the way of forming
      industrial schools would vanish!
   </p>
   <p>
      “It was said by the late stipendiary magistrate at Liverpool,
      that he had ascertained that ten such children, under fourteen
      years of age had cost, in apprehension and imprisonment, upwards of
      six hundred pounds; and, with so little effect, that all of them
      were then in prison, and one, only about ten years of age, lay
      under sentence of transportation for seven years.
   </p>
   <p>
      “The remedy for these enormous evils appears simple and obvious.
      Let the committee or the magistrate be empowered to send all such
      mendicant children to the schools of industry at the expense of
      the parent or the parish, and let the worthless parent be punished
      if he neglects the sacred duty of maintaining his child, which at
      present he is allowed to do with impunity.”

<p>
   We think the friends of our Houses of Refuge could scarcely
   ask a more sensible and cogent argument in support of such
   establishments, than is furnished in these brief extracts; and yet
   cogent and sensible as it may be, it fails to convince gainsayers,
   or at least, to constrain them to prompt and liberal action.
   Within a twelvemonth a project for such an establishment was lost
   in a neighboring State, (as it was alleged,) in some political
   whirlpool; and the public prints tell us, that a like wholesome
   measure was lately defeated in St. Louis by the jealousy or
   arrogance of a religious party. We do not vouch for the truth of
   either of these statements, but we hazard nothing in saying, that
   the problem, how to restrain and suppress crime, will never be
   solved, till politicians and religionists lose their selfishness
   and their bigotry in an earnest and efficient effort to provide for
   vicious and neglected children.
</p>
<p>
   The following good old Saxon principle is adverted to in a
   report on Parochial Union Schools for 1851.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      “Guardians are not always so open to considerations of ultimate
      as of immediate economy; and many a pauper who now, before his
      death, costs his parish one or two hundred pounds, might have lived
      without relief, had a different education, represented perhaps by
      the additional expense of a single pound, been bestowed upon him
      in his youth! This is strictly retributive justice; and I think it
      would be good policy to increase its effect, and it would give a
      prodigious stimulus to the diffusion of education, if the expense
      of every criminal, while in prison, were reimbursed to the country
      by the parish in which he had a settlement. What a stir would be
      created in any parish by the receipt of a demand from the Secretary
      of State for the Home Department for 80<i>l</i>. for the support of
      two criminals during the past year! I cannot but think that the
      locality where they had been brought up would be immediately
      investigated, perhaps some wretched hovels, before unregarded,
      made known, and means taken to educate and civilize families that
      had brought such grievous taxation on the parish. The expense of
      keeping criminals, as of paupers, must be borne somewhere; and it
      seems more just that it should fall on those parishes whose neglect
      has probably caused the crime than on the general purse.”
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   We would gladly pursue the discussion of these interesting
   topics did our limits allow, but we have indicated one important,
   and as it seems to us indispensable preliminary inquiry,
   viz.:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">Page 78</a></span>
   Can we effectually carry out any general scheme of reform, except
   we withdraw neglected and vicious children from the associations
   and habits of their miserable and degraded homes, and put them
   upon a course of involuntary moral and industrial training, before
   they become what are technically called juvenile delinquents? Is
   not a compulsory process (much earlier in its application than the
   discipline of a House of Refuge) essential to the accomplishment
   of any general or comprehensive reform? Will such a process be
   authorized by any popular legislature in our country? If the
   question implies an answer, is the answer true?

<p>
   In the Eastern State Penitentiary, the labor of the prisoners
   has nearly defrayed the expense of their subsistence; while in the
   Western State Penitentiary, the labor of the convicts has not only
   earned their support, but has paid four-fifths the salaries of the
   officers.
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">Page 79</a></p>

<p>
   The number of commitments to the Western State Penitentiary has
   increased so much, as to require the erection of a new range of
   cells—for want of which in the crowded state of the prison,
   the required separation has been in some cases impracticable. But
   no departure from the strict observance of the discipline has been
   allowed, except where a necessity which knows no law, required
   it.
</p>
<p>
   If it should be supposed that the apparent increase of crime
   betokens the inefficiency of the discipline, it would be an
   unwarranted inference. The increased number of convictions
   might tend to show the increase of crime, or of sagacity and
   thoroughness in detecting and prosecuting it; but there is another
   and abundantly adequate cause to account for the increase in
   the present case, and it is the one assigned by the inspectors,
   viz.—the intemperate use of intoxicating drinks. Of the
   ninety-six received during the year, eighty-nine are regarded
   as having been brought to the felon’s home by such indulgence!
   Of one hundred and twenty-six received into the Eastern State
   Penitentiary during the year, only thirty-two are registered as
   temperate, leaving ninety-four on the list of drinkers, moderate or
   immoderate.
</p>
<p>
   Of the one hundred and twenty-six admissions to the Eastern
   State Penitentiary, ninety-eight were never apprenticed to a trade;
   and of one hundred and eighty-seven in custody at the Western State
   Penitentiary at the date of the report, forty-one were never bound;
   and of the one hundred and forty-six that were bound, ninety-seven
   (or two-thirds) ran away from their masters!
</p>
<p>
   Among the 126 admissions to the Eastern State Penitentiary,
   there were fifty-six different trades or occupations, and of
   thirty-eight of these only one representative. The largest of any
   class were laborers, 27; the next, boatmen, 10; shoemakers, 7;
   and store-keepers, and farmers, and butchers, 5 each. Of the 187
   in custody at the Western State Penitentiary at date of report,
   67 were laborers, 18 shoemakers, 12 boatmen, of farmers and
   blacksmiths 6 each, cooks, 5.
</p>
<p>
   The Warden of the Eastern State Penitentiary gives us, as the
   result of another year’s experience, an increased conviction of
   the unabated confidence and regard to which the system of<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">Page 80</a></span> separate
   confinement is entitled; and the Warden of the Western State
   Penitentiary speaks of the success of the past year “as having
   proved the separate system to be what its earliest friends
   desired.”
</p>
<p>
   In the report of the medical officer of the Eastern State
   Penitentiary we have the following testimony:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      I think I may state without hesitation, that there has never
      been, during the history of the institution, so great an exemption
      from disease for so long a time, as during the period for which I
      now report. There are but four men in the Infirmary who are not
      at work. It is true, there are some others in delicate or infirm
      health, but the greater part of these were received in that state,
      of whom again the majority are greatly improved.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   And from the medical officer of the Western State Penitentiary
   we have a similar report of the uniform prevalence of good health.
   There has been less indisposition within the prison during the year
   just terminated, he says, “than during any similar period of time
   since my professional connection with this institution, and yet the
   number of prisoners has never been so great.”
</p>
<p>
   As to the mental health of the convicts in the Eastern State
   Penitentiary, the physician reports it to be “no less satisfactory
   than their physical condition;” and of the Western State
   Penitentiary the medical report is, that “no case of insanity has
   originated within the prison during the year.”
</p>
<p>
   Of the sentences of the one hundred and twenty-six admitted,
   ninety-one were for three years or less. And of ninety-six received
   into the Western State Penitentiary, seventy-five were sentenced
   for three years or less.
</p>
<p>
   Of the one hundred and twenty-six commitments to the Eastern
   State Penitentiary, ninety-six were for offences against property,
   only seven of which were accompanied with violence; twenty-five
   were for offences against the person, and five for violation of
   marriage laws. While of the ninety-six admissions to the Western
   State Penitentiary, eighty were for offences against property
   with and without violence, and sixteen were for offences against
   the person. The general summary of the two Institutions is as
   follows:

<p>
   A very slight examination of this statement reveals some
   singular differences, especially in the items of pardons and
   deaths, which an analysis of the annual returns would doubtless
   satisfactorily explain.
</p>
<p>
   The moral instructor in the Eastern State Penitentiary adverts
   to the circumstance that only nineteen of the one hundred and
   twenty-six commitments were over thirty-five years of age, and
   that twenty-eight were under twenty. He very justly regards the
   ignorant, vicious and depraved <span class="smcap">youth</span>
   of the land as the reservoir of convicts. The moral instructor of
   the Western State Penitentiary says, “there is a larger proportion
   of mere youths in the prison than at any former time. More than
   three-fourths of the prisoners confined within these walls have
   confessed to me that their early youth was passed almost entirely
   without moral teachings. The records of our Courts bear ample
   testimony to the fearful and distressing increase of crime among
   our youth. There are in this prison, received within the past year,
   nineteen convicts not over twenty-one years of age!”
</p>
<p>
   These considerations show the seasonableness and importance of a
   proposition from the Managers of our House of Refuge, which will be
   found on our last page.
</p>
<p>
   A large section of the report of the inspectors of the Eastern
   State Penitentiary is occupied by a discussion of the provisions
   of the Act of Assembly of May 4, 1852, and the proceedings under
   it, to which we shall make more particular reference in a separate
   article.

<p>
   <span class="smcap">The</span> General Appropriation Act of 1852,
   provides $25,000 to complete the unfinished range of cells of the
   Western State Penitentiary, and for the payment of gratuities to
   convicts discharged from the two penitentiaries, $1417, viz.:
   $667 to the Eastern, and the remainder ($750) to the Western.

   Quarter Sessions of the County, from which such prisoners were sent
   to the Penitentiary, of all such removals or transfers.”
</p>
<p>
   In pursuance of the authority enforced by this law, the
   commissioners met at the Penitentiary on the 20th of October last,
   and at various times thereafter, and examined eighteen cases
   presented for their investigation—eight of whom they regard
   as proper subjects of hospital treatment; two, they think, will be
   as well or better off where they are; the sentence of one expired
   during the pendency of the proceedings, and he was discharged,
   four are not suitable inmates of an Insane Hospital, and three,
   who were committed for safe keeping, are regarded on all hands as
   unfit to be placed in any hospital, or elsewhere where the means
   of close custody are less efficient than in the Eastern State
   Penitentiary.
</p>
<p>
   In the course of their report to the executive, the
   Commissioners very properly speak of it as a grave question, how
   far it is justifiable to mingle convicted criminals (however
   afflicted) amongst the meanest whom the hand of God has visited
   with mental derangement, or how many insane criminals can be sent
   there without seriously jeopardizing the best interests of that
   institution, and risking the safety and well being of its inmates.
   They add, “that no wards can be specially appropriated to the class
   particularly under notice, and as a consequence the insane criminal
   must be in contact directly with the insane innocent.”
</p>
<p>
   In the absence of a hospital constructed with exclusive
   reference to the custody and treatment of convicts deprived of
   their reason, and considering “the great security afforded by
   the penitentiary and the character of its arrangements,” the
   Commissioners are of the opinion, that “it will be quite possible,
   inside its enclosure, to make the limited number of this class now
   confined there, more comfortable than they could be in any ordinary
   hospital, for the reason, where a just regard to the safety of
   others would require a much closer degree of confinement,” in which
   opinion we cordially coincide.
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">Page 84</a></p>

<p>
   As this is the first proceeding under the provision of the
   law, it has received particular attention in the report of the
   Inspectors, and may claim a brief notice in our pages.
</p>
<p>
   And we must in the first place take exception to the
   phraseology in a clause of the Act of Assembly, which is open to
   misconstruction. “A certain class of prisoners” is mentioned,
   “whose mental and physical condition may require, in the opinion of
   the Inspectors, a temporary relaxation of the separate confinement
   system.” The framers of this paragraph were probably unaware that
   all the provision which any body ever considered necessary for
   the class of prisoners alluded to, may be enjoyed without any
   “relaxation (temporary or permanent) of the separate confinement
   system.”
</p>
<p>
   It is the <em>unbroken solitude</em> which, by an existing
   law, should be relieved two or three times a day, but in some
   past periods has not been relieved for days together; it is the
   confinement to an unwholesome or stultifying trade; it is the
   brooding over a seven or ten years’ sentence, a ruined and helpless
   family, and a blasted reputation,—these are the causes,
   and not <em>separation</em> from other convicts that threaten
   to undermine the health and derange the reason of convicts of a
   peculiar temperament. Now, if the money appropriated could be
   expended in a few extra lodges, with ample exercising yards, and
   perhaps one-tenth of it for an additional attendant or two, to have
   charge of enfeebled prisoners (whether they were so when admitted,
   or became so as a natural effect of prison-life) this provision
   of the section would be very reasonable. The <em>separation</em>,
   however, may safely and should certainly remain intact.
</p>
<p>
   But there is another class of convicts whose case is embraced
   by a <em>proviso</em>. It is those who “develope such marked
   insanity as to render their continuance in the penitentiary
   improper, and their removal to the State hospital necessary to
   their restoration.” In order to determine whether a convict answers
   to this description, a competent Board is appointed to examine and
   report.
</p>
<p>
   Now we will suppose a case is presented of a prisoner
   who was committed for <em>safe keeping</em> merely. This
   is certainly not a case within the proviso. No matter how
   marked the insanity is, it was developed before commitment,
   and his continued confinement<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_85">Page 85</a></span> is, therefore, in no sense
   “improper.” Competent authorities disposed of him with due
   reference to all the circumstances of the case, and the Act of the
   Legislature is not designed to disturb the acts judiciary.
</p>
<p>
   Another case is presented to the Board, and they are satisfied
   that it is a “manifest” development of insanity, but that with
   proper medical treatment, and such out-of-door exercise as is quite
   compatible with the discipline of the institution, the party may be
   restored. This is clearly not within the proviso, for it is only
   such cases as make “<em>a removal to the State Hospital necessary
   to their restoration</em>,” that are to be transferred. It is
   evident, therefore, that the medical Board are not to be restricted
   to the inquiry, whether there is or is not a development of
   insanity, but whether the case presented is one which the proviso
   meant to include. The medical Board are presumed to know the
   provisions of the act from which they derive their authority, and
   they cannot read it without perceiving that they are to decide not
   only whether a prisoner is insane, but also whether his insanity
   is of such a type or character as to render his continuance in
   the prison <em>improper</em>, and a removal to the State hospital
   indispensable to his recovery. Now, suppose they are satisfied of
   the insanity, and also that his removal to the State hospital or
   elsewhere would not be likely to restore him. This is the very
   point for which their professional knowledge and experience is
   required—quite as much as (if not more than) to determine
   the naked question of insanity. Surely a wise Legislature could
   not have meant to ask a <em>medical Board</em> to determine the
   question of insanity, and leave it to the <em>Inspectors</em> to
   say whether the insanity might be safely and properly treated in
   the prison, or whether a removal to the State Hospital would be
   likely to issue in restoration!
</p>
<p>
   On the whole therefore it must be obvious, we think, to any candid
   mind, that the Legislature designed to give the Inspectors the
   benefit of the <em>official judgment</em> of a competent Board,
   as to the manner in which they should treat or dispose of insane
   convicts.
</p>
<p>
   Upon the general question of the removal of any insane convicts
   to the State Asylum, we indicated an opinion in our number for
   July, 1852, and farther inquiry and reflection confirms<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">Page 86</a></span> the doubt
   then expressed, whether a general State Lunatic Hospital should
   receive convicts of any class.
</p>
<p>
   If an offender has been convicted and sentenced according to
   law, he must be regarded and received into the cell as a suitable
   subject of convict-discipline. A process of law so terminated, is
   tantamount to incontrovertible evidence, that the party is in all
   respects amenable to the penal sanctions of the law. Otherwise he
   is not a convict, but an oppressed and abused sufferer. Having
   thus been committed, he must abide the life of a convict. If his
   health fails, humane provision should be made for him in a proper
   apartment, called an infirmary or hospital, with proper attendance,
   medicine, nourishment, &amp;c., but why should he be pardoned,
   removed or discharged? Sickness in prison is one of the risks he
   voluntarily takes in committing the offence. If he breaks a limb or
   loses an eye, it is what happens to honest men as well as convicts,
   and he can claim no exemption from such calamities, and must be
   satisfied with prison fare when they overtake him as a convict.
   Why should the failure or loss of mental soundness be a cause of
   discharging a prisoner, any more than the weakness or maiming of
   the body? Why should not provision be made within the prison-bounds
   for the proper care and treatment of this class of ailments, as
   well as any other? Certainly not because it is not practicable
   to do it, for the medical records show that the recoveries
   among convict-lunatics here and in England, bear quite as high
   a proportion to the cases, as in our best Insane Asylums. If it
   should be maintained that the proper room and attendance cannot be
   obtained, the same reason might be urged for discharging the sick
   and lame, that there was no room for an infirmary, nor for surgical
   operations, nor for nurses, &amp;c. We do not see what reasonable
   ground can be urged for the removal of the former, which might not
   be quite as tenable in relation to the latter.
</p>
<p>
   It seems to us that when the Commonwealth, whose peace and
   dignity have been violated by a breach of the law, seizes on
   the offender, and separates him from honest citizens, clearly
   proves his guilt, and commits him for punishment to hard labor in
   the penitentiary for a term of months or years, nothing should
   avail to discharge him from that sentence, except the discovery
   of some evidence of its injustice. It is assumed, of<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">Page 87</a></span> course,
   that he has been legally and fairly dealt with in the whole
   process of the prosecution, and that the sentence is as light as
   the law or the circumstances of the case will justify; and this
   being conceded, we confidently maintain that the State takes him
   into her custody as a convict, and that, as a convict she is
   bound to provide for him whatever he needs, whether in health or
   sickness, in strength or weakness, in life or death, until he has
   accomplished his full term.
</p>
<p>
   We venture to make these suggestions the more plainly, because
   we perceive not a little confusion in the views which are gaining
   ground on the subject.
</p>
<p>
   In the recent report of the Inspectors of the Eastern State
   Penitentiary, cases are mentioned of prisoners who were clearly
   insane when first sentenced to the Penitentiary. How this fact was
   proved in any case, does not appear. The question would be relieved
   of much embarrassment if it did. But the report hazards another and
   much graver remark, viz: that the “experience and observation” (of
   the Inspectors) “have convinced them that the commission of crime
   is more frequently connected with mental disease than courts or
   juries suspect.” We had supposed that the danger, if any, was in
   the opposite direction. It must be very rare, we apprehend, that
   the plea of insanity is not urged where there is the slightest
   pretence to sustain it. And courts and juries, in our country at
   least, have been regarded as quite sufficiently indulgent towards
   it whenever it is urged.
</p>
<p>
   It is scarcely safe, as it seems to us, after conviction by due
   course of law, to go behind the proceedings and attempt to avert
   their legitimate consequences by alleging the existence of a fact
   which should have stayed them entirely. That property is taken,
   mischief committed, and violent deeds done by persons of insane
   mind and of course irresponsible for their acts, we all know; but
   these acts are not offences, nor are the perpetrators of them
   offenders, nor can they, by any process of law, be turned into
   convicts. Yet the time to show this (if it is not plainly apparent)
   is when they are arrested for such acts, and their state of mind
   is relied on to exempt them from any responsibility. If it is not
   shown then, it is our duty (in ordinary circumstances) forever
   after to hold our peace.
</p>
<p>
   It is not our province to vindicate the established tribunals of
   the country from the charge of “presumption” or “inhumanity,”<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">Page 88</a></span> when they
   direct a maniac, who, in a paroxysm of his malady, has taken the
   life of his wife or his friend, to be confined within the cells
   of a penitentiary as one dangerous to society. But we suppose the
   community has a claim to be protected against the violence of the
   lawless, whether they are rendered so by the visitation of God or
   by the indulgence of depraved and malevolent passions.
</p>
<p>
   That this protection can be made sure by existing arrangements
   in our State Hospital, or that adequate provision can be made
   therein without injuriously affecting the interests of third
   parties, we are not prepared to say. But we are well persuaded
   that proper provision for all classes of convicts, whatever
   their physical or mental condition, can be made in either of our
   State Penitentiaries; and we shall not cease to consider those
   institutions very imperfectly constructed or organized, so long as
   such provision is not made within their walls.
</p>
<p>
   Before our readers pronounce judgment on these views, we trust
   they will take sober thought and established facts into their
   counsels.
</p>
<p>
   While these sheets were passing through the press, we were
   favored with the report of the New York State Lunatic Asylum
   at Utica, for the current year, in which the most emphatic
   remonstrance is made to sending thither persons acquitted of crime,
   on the ground of insanity, or convicts who become insane. The
   reasons are plainly stated:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      These unfortunate persons are discharged from punishment and
      committed to the asylum. The buildings not having been designed
      for the custody of this class of the insane, they cause much extra
      expense, watchfulness and care; and as experience shows, with but
      little prospect of benefit. The number is constantly increasing
      and encroaching upon space which might be more usefully devoted
      to patients who are likely to be improved, and for whom the
      institution was originally designed. Many of the class referred to
      are of the most depraved character, and quite unfit associates for
      the other inmates, who, for the most part, are persons of worth
      and respectability, and entitled to be protected against dangerous
      associations.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   The mischiefs which are so clearly exposed by the Managers, are
   still farther exhibited in the report of the principal physician,
   who regards convict-lunatics as requiring more secure<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">Page 89</a></span> fixtures
   and stricter surveillance than ordinary patients, and for these
   and the worst class of drunkards, he recommends “the erection of
   a hospital for two hundred and fifty patients of the male sex
   only, to be carefully constructed, and fitted for the ultimate
   occupancy of lunatic criminals only; but to be used, until needed
   exclusively for this purpose, by criminal and homicidal lunatics
   and drunkards.”
</p>
<p>
   We think these views and suggestions must commend themselves to
   all reflecting minds, and we hope to see them carried out.
</p>
<p>
   We offer no apology for occupying so much of our limited
   space with this subject, inasmuch as the interests of
   <em>philanthropy</em> are involved in protecting our State Lunatic
   Hospitals from being prejudiced by the introduction of patients
   who do not properly fall under their care, and the interests of
   <em>prison discipline</em> require that the convict should not be
   released from any measure of retribution for his offence, which a
   lawful sentence imposes.

   <h2 id="Art_VI">
      <span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span>—REPORT OF THE CONDITION OF
      THE NEW JERSEY STATE PRISON.
   </h2>
   <p class="chapheader">
      —Embracing the reports of the Joint Committee, Inspectors,
      Keeper, Moral Instructor and Physician. January 19, 1853. pp. 48.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   <span class="smcap">We</span> have been favored with the report of
   this institution for the year 1852-3. There were in confinement, at
   the beginning of the year, two hundred and seven. Received during
   the year one hundred and twenty-one, and in custody in the course
   of the year three hundred and twenty-nine different individuals.
   Of these, sixty-eight were discharged by expiration of sentence,
   and nearly the same number (viz. 63) by pardon! One death occurred,
   leaving one hundred and ninety-seven prisoners on hand at the close
   of the year. The average monthly population of the prison was two
   hundred and ten, which is a large increase on the previous year.
</p>
<p>
   Of the one hundred and ninety-seven on hand, seventy-two are
   in on a sentence of five years or upwards; thirty-four for three
   years and upwards, forty-eight for between one and three<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">Page 90</a></span> years, and
   forty-three for one year or less. Of the whole number thirty-eight
   were under twenty; eighty-one between twenty and thirty, and
   forty-nine between thirty and forty; showing that one hundred and
   sixty-eight out of the one hundred and ninety-seven, or <span
   class="smcap">four-fifths</span>, were under middle life.
</p>
<p>
   The offences are divided about equally between those against
   property and those against the person. Of the latter the
   extraordinary number of fourteen are for rape, and five for an
   assault with intent to commit that crime, and fourteen were
   counterfeiters. Eighty-nine, or nearly half the convicts, are
   natives of New Jersey; sixty-three are of foreign birth. Only
   eight females are in the prison, four white and four colored; and
   of the one hundred and eighty-nine males, forty-nine are colored.
   It is worthy of observation, that of one hundred and twenty-two
   commitments last year, sixty, or about one half, had no trade!
</p>
<p>
   In respect to the physical health of the convicts, we are
   informed that only one death occurred during the year, and this
   was by suicide. It was a young German, who had been in prison
   only five days, and whose sentence was only six months. We do not
   learn that any one at Trenton ascribes this melancholy event to
   the effect of convict-separation, but it would be in keeping with
   the spirit which has sometimes manifested itself in discussions of
   this subject, to set it down as one of the fruits of the separate
   system!
</p>
<p>
   The State Prison of New Jersey is established on the principle
   of individual separation. The law provides, that “every convict
   shall be confined in one of the cells of the prison, separate and
   alone, except in such cases of sickness as are by the act provided
   for.” That is, if the physician reports to the keeper that a
   prisoner requires a nurse, the keeper, with the approbation of the
   acting Inspectors, may employ one of the prisoners; and “whenever,
   in the opinion of the physician, the enlargement of any prisoner
   shall be absolutely necessary to the preservation of life,” he may
   be removed from his cell, “but the prisoner shall in every such
   case be kept from the society of other prisoners, except such as
   may attend as nurses.”
</p>
<p>
   No language could more clearly express the will of
   the Legislature that convict-separation should be the
   basis of the discipline. In addition to these positive
   requirements, the Inspectors<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_91">Page 91</a></span> are to embrace, in their
   annual report to the Legislature, “such remarks and statements
   respecting the system of <em>separate confinement</em> and the
   efficiency of the same, as shall be the result of their own
   observation.” The same act authorizes them to make rules and
   regulations for the prison as they may deem necessary and proper,
   “<em>consistent with the principle of separate confinement</em> and
   the laws of the State.”
</p>
<p>
   Now we might naturally suppose that a body of law-makers, receiving
   such a report of the condition of a body of convicted law-breakers,
   from those who are appointed to take care of them, would be slow
   to countenance any direct and palpable breach of the law by
   themselves; and yet it must have been known to the Legislature
   of New Jersey that the provisions of the law establishing the
   State prison, are rendered entirely nugatory by their neglect to
   provide means for executing them. They are supposed to know that
   the prison contains but one hundred and ninety-two cells, and that
   ten of these are occupied for workshops and store-rooms. A brisk
   walk of five minutes would supply the honorable the Legislature
   with demonstrative evidence that one hundred and eighty-two cells
   would not suffice for the separate confinement of two hundred
   and thirty-two prisoners, and hence they would see fifty cells
   (7½ by 16 feet) occupied by two tenants each, against the
   peace and dignity of the Commonwealth (which has forbidden such
   association) and of course “against the form of the statute in such
   case made and provided.”
</p>
<p>
   In such an emergency, we might further suppose that measures
   would be adopted at once to enlarge the accommodations and to
   obviate the alleged necessity for thus openly violating the law,
   as early as possible. With this impression, we are surprised
   that the Executive of the State, whose particular function it
   is to see that the laws are duly executed, does not urge prompt
   action in the premises. So far from any intimation of this sort,
   he speaks of the administration and management of the prison
   throughout, as eminently successful and commendable; of the
   keeper and officers as having sustained their reputation for
   ability and efficiency—of <em>five thousand dollars</em>
   of surplus earnings as having been paid into the State
   treasury during the year—and of about <em>two thousand
   dollars</em> paid to discharged<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_92">Page 92</a></span> convicts for overwork, all
   which he thinks exhibits unexampled prosperity in the affairs of
   the prison.
</p>
<p>
   He even goes so far as to say, “<em>that the discipline has been
   well maintained</em>,” adding (rather paradoxically we think,) that
   the “large number of prisoners renders it impracticable to observe
   the law in relation to solitary” (separate) “confinement, and the
   necessity of association impairs to some extent the corrective
   regulations of the institution.”
</p>
<p>
   We humbly submit that it is not the “necessity of association,”
   but the association itself that does the mischief, and farther that
   Jerseymen would better understand the case if it were said in plain
   English, that until cells enough are built to give each convict
   a cell by himself, the occupants will be more likely to become
   worse than better, at the expense of the State, and in deliberate
   violation of its positive laws.
</p>
<p>
   This view of the case becomes quite imposing, when it is
   considered that of the one hundred and ninety-seven convicts,
   one hundred and sixty-eight are, or about four-fifths, are in on
   a first conviction. Of course, every precaution is essential to
   give the discipline of the prison its most benign and efficient
   influence. It is passing strange that an enlightened State should
   pocket five thousand dollars of the surplus earnings of her
   convict-population, while the accommodations for accomplishing the
   only legitimate objects of the prison are so narrow as to require
   a constant violation of the law, and a constant defeat of its
   wholesome ends. It may be, however, that to violate laws has become
   the rule, and to obey them the exception. As an illustration,
   it may suffice to say, in respect to this same New Jersey State
   Prison, that the use of tobacco in any form is peremptorily
   forbidden by law; yet we are informed, on indisputable authority,
   that the prisoners both chew and smoke, and that some of them have
   taken their first lessons in these arts after their admission to
   the prison!
</p>
<p>
   We have made these suggestions with much freedom, and we hope
   without offence. We have hearty, intelligent co-adjutors in Jersey,
   who are aiming with us to establish the convict-discipline of the
   country on a truly humane, efficient, philosophical and Christian
   basis. To this end, we maintain that every prison or place of
   confinement for persons charged with or convicted of crime, should
   furnish a suitable apartment for each<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_93">Page 93</a></span> individual, separate from
   every other individual suspected or convicted of crime. We have
   often cited the State prison at Trenton as one of this class, and
   have uniformly espoused the views of the Inspectors and principal
   officers, at times when they were opposed by crotchety speculators
   within or without the prison; and we shall be greatly disappointed,
   if means are not promptly used to conform the discipline to the
   provisions of law.

      <span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span>—AN EXTRAORDINARY DOCUMENT.
   </h2>
</div>

<p>
   <span class="smcap">We</span> have before us a stitched pamphlet,
   entitled “Report on the Subject of Prisons, by Rev. Alexander L.
   Hamilton, State Commissioner, to Hon. Austin King, Governor of
   Missouri—Referred to the Committee on the Penitentiary, and
   three thousand copies ordered to be printed, January 5, 1853,” pp.
   24.
</p>
<p>
   The author of this report is, we doubt not, a very worthy
   and intelligent gentleman, or he would not have been appointed
   by the Executive of Missouri on so important an agency. That he
   has fulfilled his mission to the best of his ability, we may
   also admit; but that his report contains “such information as is
   necessary to present the subject of Prison Discipline fully to the
   consideration of the next general assembly of Missouri,” we cannot
   believe. Indeed we do not hesitate to say that it is entirely
   deficient in every point that a report on such a subject, for such
   a purpose, should embrace.
</p>
<p>
   Statements are made, which have been disproved over and over
   again, until the repetition of them is loathsome to those who
   have been familiar with the subject. Principles are set forth as
   of present validity, which have been long ago abandoned even by
   those who once advocated them. The most ultra partisan opinions
   and doctrines are revived, with such an air of sincerity and
   confidence, as leads us to believe that the Rev. Commissioner
   never saw or heard of the oft-repeated refutation of them. He
   refers to those whose minds are steeped in prejudice, as the most
   reliable and responsible sources of information; and perhaps we
   cannot better describe the document, as a<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_94">Page 94</a></span> whole, than by saying that
   it is a synopsis of the reports of the Boston Prison Discipline
   Society and Mr. Gray’s book, prepared and printed at the expense of
   the State of Missouri.
</p>
<p>
   We owe it to ourselves to cite a passage or two from the report,
   to serve as an indication of the qualities we have mentioned.
</p>
<p>
   As to its rhetoric and logic let the following suffice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      The conviction forces itself upon my mind, that, if the numerous
      weighty objections already given be correct—this (the separate)
      system is not only wrong <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
      se</span>, but will soon be deserted by its remaining followers.
      For if it be true, when alluding to it in the least objectionable
      manner, that this system is only suited to short sentences, as
      many of its friends and advocates aver, then, “to all intents and
      purposes,” it must soon be subject to one of two consequences;
      either the penal code of the laws of the land must be so altered as
      to suit the demand of the system, or the system must be so altered
      as to fully come within the demands of the law.
   </p>
</div>

<p>As to its facts let the following suffice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      Upon the separate and solitary principle, the
      prisoner—good, bad, or indifferent as he may be, surrounded
      by his <em>Bible</em>, and such other good books as are given him
      from time to time, remains all alone in his cell, from the first
      of January to the last of December, until his term of imprisonment
      expires; and is thus left to his own reflections by day, and by
      night—unless paid an occasional visit by some kind officer of
      the prison, or by the chaplain. And hence it is, that in too many
      instances to justify the means employed, <em>insanity</em> precedes
      the work of reformation.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
   Were we to cite but a single passage from the report to include
   the logic, the rhetoric, the philosophy, the facts, and the
   reliability of the statements in a single view, it would be the
   following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      Upon my arrival in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, so
      soon as I had visited the State prison at Charlestown, and the
      Boston new jail, under the guidance of Hon. Louis Dwight, I was
      convinced in my own mind that said jail, for the purposes for
      which it was designed, was decidedly the <em>model prison of the
      age</em>.
      </p>
</div>

<p>
   The commissioner was so fortunate as not only to see “the<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">Page 95</a></span> model
   prison of the age,” but to obtain from the same source “a design
   of a model prison for the State of Missouri;” and so comprehensive
   and clear were the conceptions of the commissioner upon the view of
   these model edifices and plans, that he made up his mind when he
   “first saw the design,” (and his views remained unchanged after his
   return,) “that it has no superior either in the United States or in
   Europe.”
</p>
<p>
   Among the inexplicable mis-statements which we find scattered
   through the report, we may cite the following:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      As has been proven, beyond all successful contradiction, this
      system (the congregate) is not only <em>more humane</em>, but it is
      also <em>far less expensive</em> than the separate system.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   Nothing is more obvious than that from the very nature of the
   discipline, the administration of a prison on the separate plan
   must be the least expensive. The first cost of the structure will
   probably be greater; but we have supposed it to be conceded on all
   hands, that a prison on this plan once erected, the expenses of
   maintaining it were much less than those of a congregate prison
   with equal accommodations.
</p>
<p>
   While we admit that the first cost of a prison for
   convict-separation is greater than that of a congregate prison,
   we must demur to the Rev. Commissioner’s broad assertion on this
   point:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      “I speak not unadvisedly,” he says, “when I assert, that
      the erection of a prison for associate purposes, is not half
      so expensive, as the erection of a prison for the separate
      and solitary confinement of its inmates—all things
      considered.”
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   The most zealous opposers of the separate system have not pushed
   this objection to any such extreme, and to any considerate mind it
   carries its refutation with it.
</p>
<p>
   As an inducement to proceed on the plan submitted by the
   commissioner, he assures the executive that “the prison once
   completed and properly officered, unless in case of some unforeseen
   accident, will demand of the State treasury nothing more for at
   least fifty years! And more than that,” he says, “after paying
   for itself during the first few years of its existence, it will
   thenceforth yield annually a handsome revenue to the State.”
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">Page 96</a></p>

<p>
   The cost of the Missouri “Model Prison” is set down at $250,000,
   and as a sort of guaranty against any new expense for improvement
   in after times, the commissioner has the assurance of one
   gentleman, (which another promptly endorses,) that “the principles
   of the main building are such as will last for one hundred years!”
   This gives a chance for a long nap to our Boston friends.
</p>
<p>
   We are not without hope that some of the good citizens of
   Missouri will get a glimpse of this report of the Rev. Alexander
   L. Hamilton, and will insist upon a more intelligent and impartial
   inquiry, before they commit themselves, or suffer the Legislature
   to commit itself to so large an expenditure, for an institution so
   permanent, and involving so many interests of humanity and public
   economy.

   </h2>
</div>

<p>
   <span class="smcap">Will</span> the publishers of the <cite>Prison
   Journal</cite>, or some one who has access to its columns enlighten
   an honest inquirer after the path of duty? It is presumed that the
   combined wisdom and philanthropy of the Prison Society can furnish
   all needed direction in the case I have at heart and in hand.
</p>
<p>
   Of the grave and multiplied evils that spring from <em>street
   begging</em>, I have no doubt. Indeed I have done all I could in a
   private way to discountenance it. I have never encouraged a second
   call by a liberal donation, and perhaps have sometimes seemed harsh
   and unfeeling. But I am so well satisfied that it is the most
   inhuman thing we can do for the honest poor, and that it favors
   the arts and schemes of the dishonest, that I feel constrained
   to avoid every thing that should look like countenancing it. My
   neighbor’s gate and door are daily besieged by women and children
   with boys and baskets, and they seldom leave without some token of
   approval.
</p>
<p>
   But I must hasten to a statement of my case. I was going
   to my place of business on Saturday afternoon, after dining
   heartily and happily upon a rare sirloin of beef, and saw a man
   on the door-steps of a house in Washington Square. He was<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">Page 97</a></span> perhaps
   forty years old, (more or less) rather shabbily dressed, with a
   dirty bundle under his arm, and some indications of hard drinking
   about his face. I noticed that he tried the handle of the door
   before he rang the bell, and was thus led to no very favorable
   impression of his design. Stepping behind a flight of steps, I
   noticed his movements as he went from door to door under successive
   rebuffs. As soon as he came up to my standing place, I said to
   him,
</p>
<p>
   “Friend, do you know you are liable to be taken up for begging
   in the street?”
</p>
<p>
   “I war’nt begging. I only asked for a bit of bread and cold
    meat.”
</p>
<p>
   “Well, you will have a constable after you in a few minutes if
   you don’t stop that business.”
</p>
<p>
   He turned on his heel and went from me, and as my eye followed
   him, and I remembered the well-furnished table from which I had
   just risen with no very grateful heart, I felt reproached; and
   quickening my steps, I followed and overtook him.
</p>
<p>“Do you say you are hungry, friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>
<p>“Do you live in town?”</p>
<p>“No, I came in town last night.”</p>
<p>“Where from?”</p>
<p>“From Emmettsburg.”</p>
<p>“Is that your home?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I served my time there.”</p>
<p>“What is your business?”</p>
<p>“Shoemaking.”</p>
<p>“Why did you leave Emmettsburg?”</p>
<p>“To get work.”</p>
<p>
   “Well, you had better go to the Mayor’s, at the corner of Fifth
   and Chestnut Streets, and tell him you have no food, no home and no
   work.”
</p>
<p>
   Off he went, and I followed by another route, and reached one
   door of the office, just as he entered at the other. Unfortunately
   the Mayor was at dinner, and I could only tell my story to the
   officer in attendance.
</p>
<p>What shall be done with such a man? I asked.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">Page 98</a></p>

<p>
   “We can only send him down to Moyamensing for thirty days, or to
   Blockley,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
   Is that the only alternative—the prison, or the poor
   house, the latter with 2,700 inmates, and the former so overstocked
   as to make it a positive nuisance? Is it really so? There is
   work for one hundred men at this moment, in removing ice from
   the gutters, making the side walks passable, and the streets
   decent, and yet this able bodied vagrant must be imposed upon the
   tax-paying public as a prisoner or a pauper!
</p>
<p>
   As we left the office, we saw the Emmettsburg shoemaker ignobly
   introduced to the ward room. I hope it will not be said that this
   is a case not likely to occur often, for in that event, I shall
   feel obliged to relate half a dozen other instances which have
   occurred within my own observation, and the details of which are
   any thing but agreeable.
</p>
<p>
   I am clear in the opinion, that there must be some needless
   and sad defect in our municipal legislation or administration,
   if the power and capacity to work is found twenty-four hours in
   succession, associated with vagrancy and mendicity. Am I wrong in
   this opinion? And whether I am or not, pray tell me how to treat
   street-beggars.

<h3 id="vagrant">Vagrant Children of New York.—</h3>

<p>
   An organization has recently been effected in the city of New York,
   under the title of the “<cite>Children’s Aid Society</cite>,” the
   object of which is “to bring humane and kindly influences to bear
   on homeless boys—to preach in various modes the Gospel of
   Christ to the vagrant children of New York.”
</p>
<p>
   As an evidence of the need of some such agency, it is stated
   that in one Ward alone (the eleventh) there were in 1852, out of
   12,000 children between the ages of five and sixteen, only 7,000
   who attended school, and only 2,500 who went to Sunday-school,
   leaving 5,000 without the common privileges of education, and about
   9,000 destitute of public religious influence!
</p>
<p>
   The views of the founders of this charity are summarily
   presented in a circular as follows:
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">Page 99</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      A large multitude of children live in the city who cannot be
      placed in asylums, and yet who are uncared for and ignorant and
      vagrant. We propose to give to these work, and to bring them under
      religious influences. A central office has been taken, and an
      agent, (Charles L. Brace,) has been engaged to give his whole time
      to efforts for relieving the wants of this class. As means shall
      come in, it is designed to district the city, so that hereafter
      every Ward may have its agent, who shall be a friend to the vagrant
      child. “Boys’ Sunday Meetings” have already been formed, which we
      hope to see extended until every quarter has its place of preaching
      to boys. With these we intend to connect “Industrial Schools,”
      where the great temptations to this class, arising from want of
      work, may be removed, and where they can learn an honest trade.
      Arrangements have been made with manufacturers, by which, if we
      have the requisite funds to begin, <em>five hundred boys</em>, in
      different localities, can be supplied with paying work. We hope
      too, especially to be the means of draining the city of these
      children, by communicating with farmers, manufacturers or families
      in the country, who may have need of such for employment. When
      homeless boys are found by our agents, we mean to get them homes in
      the families of respectable, needy persons in the city, and to put
      them into the way of an honest living.
   </p>
</div>

<p>
   It has been stated, in the public prints, that of 16,000
   commitments for crime to the prisons of New York during the year,
   at least one-fourth were minors, and it is estimated that not less
   than 10,000 children in the city are daily suffering all the evils
   of vagrancy.
</p>

<h3 id="begging">Street Begging in New York.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   We have had occasion more than once to refer, in terms of high
   commendation, to the New York City organization for the relief
   of the poor, corresponding in its main features to our Union
   Benevolent Association. We regret to notice very loud and frequent
   complaints of the continuance and increase of street-begging,
   notwithstanding the laudable exertions of the Society. A leading
   city newspaper has said within a week or two, that upwards of
   a <em>half million</em> of dollars is annually spent by the
   authorities and various societies, in the way of charity, “yet
   our streets are thronged with beggars of all descriptions, and
   particularly the avenues and streets up town, in almost any of
   which, upon an average you can see from thirty to fifty going
   from house to house, to the excessive annoyance of families, who
   are often abused and insulted by them, because you do not meet
   their demands. In fact it has become a nuisance of the worst
   magnitude.”
</p>
<p>
   There is much reason to apprehend that such nuisances must work
   their own abatement. If our authorities were strong enough and
   independent enough, to lay hold of the <span class="smcap">boys and
   girls</span> who constitute the materials from which street-beggars
   are manufactured, and compel them (as a matter of public safety)
   to submit to the discipline of an educational and industrial
   school, it would make a bright opening in the prospect. Or, if
   every man, woman and child who is found begging in the street, were
   transferred at once to some charitable institution, (if they have
   infirmities which prevent them from labor,) or to some working
   institution, (if they are able-bodied,) and there put to some
   wholesome labor in exchange for their sustenance and clothing, we
   should not be without hope. But we see no way of suppressing the
   evil, if neither of these methods is feasible.
</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">Page 100</a></p>

<h3 id="ny_prison">New York Prison Association.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   We have seen only newspaper reports of the proceedings at the
   eighth anniversary of this active and very useful Association. We
   understand that their condemnation of the yoke and the shower, as
   modes of punishment, is very emphatic and unqualified, and among
   the interesting facts which are drawn from their report, we select
   the following:—
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
   <p>
      In the city of New York, since 1848, disorderly conduct (in
      almost every instance the result of strong drink) has steadily
      increased from 703 to 2,660, or 278 per cent.; intoxication has
      increased about 75 per cent., and the two together from 5,579 to
      11,280. By a comparison of the prison statistics for the last five
      years, it appears that crimes against property have increased
      only about 50 per cent.; but that crimes against the person have
      increased 129 per cent., or from 1,300 in 1843 to 2,920 in 1852.
   </p>
   <p>
      The increase has been the greatest in the highest crimes. Thus
      we find assaults to kill were 25 in 1848, and 39, 59, 61 and 75 in
      1852, or three-fold. Manslaughter, in 1848, was 3, and then 4, 16,
      11 in 1852, almost four-fold. Murder in 1848 was 9, and 9, 15, 21
      and 56 in 1852, or more than six-fold.
   </p>
   <p>
      Ninety per cent. of the whole number committed to this prison
      during the past year, were intemperate! The returns of sixteen
      State Prisons, for the year 1851, give us a grand total of 4,507
      prisoners, 3,006 of whom were imprisoned for offences against
      property, and 784 against the person.
   </p>
   <p>
      It is stated that there is a greater number of cases of bigamy
      and perjury in the State of New York, than in all the other fifteen
      States; there being twenty-one cases of bigamy in New York, and
      only fifteen in the other States; and seventeen cases of perjury to
      three in all the other States.
   </p>
   <p>
      The average period of confinement in Connecticut is six years,
      seven months, twenty-nine days; and in the Eastern Penitentiary
      of Pennsylvania it is only two years, six months and three
      days.
   </p>
</div>

<h3 id="ny_state">New York State Prisons.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   The report of the State Penitentiaries of New York bear date
   December 1, and show that 129 more convicts were in custody at
   that time than in December, 1851. Of 1843, the whole number in
   confinement, 924 were at Sing Sing, 752 at Auburn and 167 at
   Clinton. One hundred and forty-three pardons were granted, or
   about 1 in every 12 convictions! The expenses of all the prisons
   exceeded the earnings by several thousands of dollars, showing the
   fallacy of the argument so potent with most Legislatures, that by
   associating prisoners in labor they become a source of profit,
   while separating them involves great expense. The Clinton prison
   is going largely into the iron business and wants more hands. We
   would respectfully suggest, whether there are not many persons
   at large in New York, and some quite considerable in importance
   and respectable in appearance, too, who would find appropriate
   employment there.
</p>
<p>
   There has been some increase in the frequency of punishments by
   the yoke, the shower bath, the ball and chain, and solitude.
</p>
<p>
   Of 613 commitments, two-thirds confessed intemperate habits.
   How many of the rest were moderate drinkers does not appear. The
   average degree of education in the convicts received is less than
   in some former reports.
</p>
<p>
   <span class="smcap">Idiots in New York.—</span>There are
   two thousand eight hundred idiots in the State of New York. The
   report of the superintendent of the Idiot Asylum, near Albany,
   contains the following interesting passage:—“We<span
   class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">Page 101</a></span> have taught
   a child to walk when we had first to awaken or cultivate a fear
   of falling, as an incentive to any efforts on her part. We have
   awakened perceptions of sounds in ears where the sense of hearing
   resided without the use of it. We have developed perceptions of
   sight through eyes that had never performed their appropriate
   office. We have been teaching children to speak in every stage of
   articulation. Cases that three years since only promised to be
   hopeless, helpless burdens to their friends all their lives, have
   been elevated to the rank of happy, useful members of society.
   In almost all cases, and with very few, if any exceptions, those
   usually called idiots, under the age of twelve or fifteen, may be
   so trained and instructed as to render them useful to themselves,
   and fitted to learn some of the ordinary trades, or to engage in
   agriculture. Their minds and souls can be developed, so that they
   may become responsible beings, acquainted with their relations to
   their Creator and a future state, and their obligations to obey
   the laws and respect the rights of their fellow-citizens. In all
   cases, we believe, for we have seen what has been accomplished
   in apparently desperate cases, they can be made cleanly and neat
   in their personal habits, and enabled to enjoy the bounties
   of Providence and the Comforts of life, and to cease being
   incumbrances and annoyances to the families in which they reside.”
</p>

<h3 id="tempter">Be beforehand with the Tempter!—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   A friend tells us of a case in which a young girl of
   considerable personal attraction, was rescued from impending
   danger. Her mother was a widow with very scanty means of support.
   This girl had a taste for, and some skill in music. Had been at
   the public schools, and could read and write with facility, and
   was indeed respectably educated for one in her station. Her mother
   had determined to take boarders, and to give an air of gentility
   to her house, she had also made arrangements to hire a piano. The
   introduction of the class of boarders which the mother expected,
   would have exposed the child to great danger. A Christian friend
   saw this, and by timely and judicious efforts succeeded in securing
   for her a situation where she would be protected and prepared for
   usefulness, and for gaining a respectable livelihood.
</p>
<p>
   How much more hopeful such simple preventive measures are, than
   those which (though equally well meant) come later, and are at best
   but remedial in their character.
</p>

<h3 id="new_penitentiary">New Penitentiary in Massachusetts.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   We notice in the proceedings of the Legislature of Massachusetts
   that it is proposed to build a new State Prison. It is but a year
   or two since the Charlestown prison was greatly enlarged, so as to
   meet what was supposed to be the demand for convict-accommodation.
   It is earnestly to be hoped, that if a new prison should be erected
   in that State, the principle of separation will be adopted. If the
   two systems could be once fairly tried in the actual presence of
   the people of that ancient and intelligent Commonwealth, we should
   have strong confidence that the groundless prejudices against
   convict-separation would disappear, and that her example would be
   set as effectually for the furtherance of correct views on the
   important subject of prison discipline, as it has heretofore been
   cited for the furtherance of misapprehension and error.
</p>

<h3 id="state_prison_at_charlestown">State Prison at Charlestown, Mass.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   The earnings of the inmates of the Charlestown State Prison, for the year
   ending September 30th, 1852,<span class="pagenum">
   <a id="Page_102">Page 102</a></span> were $6,921.17 over expenses. Of the
   inmates, 313 are Americans, 170 foreigners, 35 negroes and 12 mulattoes.
</p>
<p>
   We have known a succession of annual reports of State prisons to
   be published, in which the earnings of the convicts, over and above
   the expenditures were quite “showy,” but by and by came a change
   in the administration, and a balance appears against the concern,
   sufficient to swallow up all the previously reported excess of
   earnings. Each report of a favorable year made its impression on
   the public mind, and hundreds of thousands who were misled by it,
   will never see a notice of the detection of the error,—to
   use no harsher term. We do not mean to intimate that there is any
   reason to distrust the foregoing item, but simply to admonish the
   reader that such statements are always to be taken with many grains
   of allowance.
</p>

<h3 id="illinois_penitentiary">Illinois Penitentiary.—</h3>

   years to a person, who allows the State a certain sum for the labor
   of the convicts, &amp;c. The report before us embraces the years
   1851 and 1852. On the first of January, 1851, the prison contained
   170 convicts. Since that time 38 have died, 41 have been pardoned,
   1 has escaped, and 168 have been discharged by expiration of
   sentence—making the whole number discharged within the past
   two years, 248. During the same period, 295 have been received, and
   the whole number now in confinement is 207. Fourteen only were born
   in the State of Illinois!

   not to exceed $35,000, and to be planned for the accommodation of
   300 boys, but finished at present for 120. An eligible site has
   been obtained, and we hope soon to hear that the institution is
   conferring wide and lasting benefits upon the community.

<p class="p2">
   At the Somersetshire Sessions, held lately at Wells, England, an
   interesting discussion took place on the subject of the punishment
   and reformation of juvenile offenders. The subject was brought
   before the Court by the reading of a circular, in which the
   magistrates were called upon to adopt a memorial to the Marquis
   of Lansdowne on this important subject. Mr. Lloyd Baker said he
   had had the subject under his consideration for the last fifteen
   years, and he laid before the Court statistics referring to the
   criminal career of a number of youths at that moment confined in
   the Gloucester County Prison, showing that they had been, most
   of them, previously convicted once or twice; that this kind of
   punishment, instead of having a moral effect upon them, appeared
   only to have hardened them in crime by their coming in contact with
   other bad adult characters, and that their trial and imprisonment
   had cost the county from $75 to $100 a-piece. His argument was in
   favor of an entirely new system of juvenile reformation. He was
   followed by other magistrates, who spoke of the course imposed
   upon them, to sentence mere children to confinement in a prison,
   as a most unsatisfactory one. There was no moral effect in such
   punishments, but, on the contrary, the effect was to break down
   the first barrier to crime, and it was found that the shame of
   imprisonment was overcome. One of them expressed an opinion that
   what was wanted was a public receptacle for offenders of this
   class who were not properly “prisoners,”<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_103">Page 103</a></span> but unfortunate individuals
   who, by neglect of their parents, had been led into error. He did
   not see why it should not be made compulsory upon such parents
   who so neglected their offspring as to lead them to crime, to
   contribute towards their support in such an establishment, in the
   same manner as a runaway parent was called upon to contribute to
   the support of his family. The discussion ended in the adoption
   of a memorial, which was signed by all the magistrates present,
   expressing their conviction, that the present mode of treating
   and disposing of juvenile offenders was most inefficient and
   unsatisfactory.

<h3 id="singular">Singular Avocation and Mode of Life in London.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   In a case of assault brought before a police-court, a most
   extraordinary character appeared as a witness. The man is by
   profession a thorough subterranean rat-catcher, for the supply
   of those who keep sporting dogs. One-half of his life is spent
   in quest of prey from the whole range of the sewerage of London.
   Furnished with a bull’s eye lantern, a good-sized folding trap, and
   a short rake, he enters the main sewer, at the foot of Blackfriar’s
   Bridge, and pursues his dangerous avocation, waist-deep in mud
   and filth of every description. The sewers literally swarm with
   rats, which he catches by hand, and places them in his cage as
   easy as if they were young kittens. His underground journeys
   extend for miles. He has been under Newgate, and along Cheapside
   to the Mansion House. He has traversed from Holborn to Islington,
   closely inspecting all the passages that enter the grand sewer of
   the mighty metropolis. On one occasion, an obstruction occurred to
   a drain at the foot of Holborn Hill. Terms were speedily agreed
   upon, and our subterranean explorer started off to the foot of
   Blackfriar’s Bridge, and in half an hour his voice was heard down
   the gully-hole; he speedily cleared away the obstruction, and
   received his reward, thus saving the expense of breaking up the
   roadway. It is not, however, to the rats alone that he pays his
   attention; he frequently falls in with a rich prize, particularly
   in the City sewers. On one occasion he found a silk purse,
   containing gold and silver; on another a gold watch and seals,
   numbers of silver spoons, rings and other articles of value. He
   has been three times attacked with the typhus fever, but rapidly
   recovered on each occasion.

<h3 id="death">Death from Separation!—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   A London paper tells us, that Mr. Bedford, the coroner for
   Westminster, held an inquest lately in Millbank Penitentiary,
   touching the death of Thomas Wilkinson, a convict, aged nineteen
   years, a clothdresser, who was found one Sunday morning lying dead
   and bleeding on the floor of his cell, having cut his throat with
   a razor which was given him to shave, <em>during the momentary
   absence of the warder in charge</em>. From the question of convict
   prison discipline having recently been slightly agitated in the
   public journals, the separate system was inquired into by the
   coroner, who asked Dr. Baily if he could throw any light on the
   case, to guide the jury as to the cause of the act. Dr. Baily
   thought that it was brooding over the length of his sentence, and
   stated further that, during eighteen years, in that prison, from
   1824 to 1842, with an average of 454 prisoners, only three had
   committed suicide, but then their sentences were only two, three or
   four years. Again, in the ten years as a convict prison, from 1843
   to 1853, there had been thirteen suicides. So that he thought it
   was more the length of the sentences than the separate confinement,
   although he must own that the latter would accelerate or aggravate
   any disease which might be on a prisoner, and also tend to suicide,
   by giving them an opportunity when they would be brooding over
   a long prospect of imprisonment. The jury returned a verdict to
   the effect that the deceased destroyed himself during a state of
   temporary insanity, <em>brought on by the separate system</em>!
</p>

<p>
   We have put a few words in italics to mark the absurdity
   of such a verdict. (1.) No evidence of insanity is stated,
   except that which the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a
   id="Page_104">Page 104</a></span> act furnishes. (2.)
   As favorable an opportunity is offered, during half of every
   twenty-four hours in a congregate, as in a separate prison. (3.)
   If it is brooding over an unusually long sentence that produces
   suicidal insanity, the verdict should be, that the deceased
   destroyed himself during a state of temporary insanity, brought on
   by a mistake of the law or of its administrators!
</p>

<h3 id="murders">Murders in Philadelphia.—</h3>
<p class="p2">
   It is our painful duty to record three deliberate and atrocious
   murders committed within the bounds of the city of Philadelphia
   since our last issue.
</p>
<p>
   The first was committed in broad day, in one of the most frequented
   parts of the city, upon a man in his own store, and was attended
   with circumstances of ferocity rarely equalled. The perpetrator of
   the deed has not been discovered.
</p>
<p>
   The second was the wanton butchery of an unoffending man,
   apparently without any motive, except the indulgence of a
   blood-thirsty malevolence.
</p>
<p>
   The third was committed upon two unprotected females, and with a
   ferocity of which we should hope few human beings are susceptible,
   even in their most savage state. The only apparent motive for the
   cruel and dastardly deed was a pittance of money. How far the
   wretched monster on whom the guilt of this double murder has been
   fixed by the law and the testimony, may have been implicated in
   other deeds of blood ascribed to him by popular rumor, it is not
   for us to say, but we suppose there is no doubt that he was not
   long since a convict in the State Penitentiary at Sing Sing, N. Y.,
   and was pardoned by the Executive of that State!
</p>
<p>
   How much of his term of punishment was abridged by this
   interposition of extraordinary clemency, we are not informed; but
   if the full execution of his sentence would have carried the period
   of his confinement beyond the 10th of March, 1853, it is clear
   that the abridgment of it opened the way for the terrible deed
   which we have now recorded. And are we not justified in holding
   the pardoning power responsible, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
   foro conscientiæ</span>, at least, for the consequences of taking
   a convict out of the hands of the ministers of justice, while he
   is undergoing wholesome discipline by their order, and sending him
   back into the community as one whose punishment was greater than
   he deserved? Who knows but that an ill-judged interposition of
   Executive power may sometimes breed a contempt for public authority,
   and stimulate a reckless convict to more audacious violations of law!

   This institution is located in Fulton. It was opened a year since,

    On the 20th of December there were 232 convicts in custody, of whom

    nativity, Ireland furnishes the largest number, and Germany the
    next largest. Of the States of the Union, Pennsylvania furnishes

         removed for neglect of duty or the violation of police regulations.
         That the Chief of Police shall be appointed by the Mayor, with the
         approval of the Board of Aldermen, and not the Common Council, as
         has been the law hitherto; that every policeman appointed must be a
         citizen of the United States, and a resident of the ward for which
         he has been nominated. He must also present to the Mayor, with his
         certificate of nomination, another, signed by twenty-five reputable
         citizens, two-thirds of whom must reside in the ward at the time of
         signing the certificate, certifying that they have been personally
         acquainted with him five years last past, and that during that time
         he has borne a good character for honesty, morality and sobriety.

         a very large number of convicts congregated in one prison, and he
         submits to the consideration of the Legislature, whether the public

<p>
   <em>Whereas</em>, The increase of Juvenile Delinquency in all
   the large cities of our country, has claimed the attention of
   philanthropists; and <em>whereas</em>, the Board of Managers of the
   House of Refuge, Philadelphia, are desirous that errors in modes of
   training the young, and other causes co-operating to produce the
   evil referred to, may be presented in such a form as to claim the
   serious consideration of parents and guardians throughout the land;
   therefore,
</p>
<p>
   <em>Resolved</em>, That the Board of Managers do offer a premium
   of one hundred dollars for the best essay, and fifty dollars for
   that next in order of merit, to be awarded by a committee of
   literary gentlemen: <em>Provided</em>, that such essays shall not
   exceed fifty octavo pages in length, and shall be contributed
   before the first day of July, A. D. 1853; and whether successful or
   not in competition, shall be at the absolute disposal of the Board
   of Managers.

   As the object of the Board of Managers of the House of Refuge in
   offering the above-named premiums, is mainly to call the attention
   of parents and guardians to errors in the prevalent modes of
   training the young—a subject which should claim the attention
   of every reader—the undersigned would call the attention of
   editors of newspapers generally, throughout the United States, to
   this advertisement, and ask the favor of an insertion of it, or of
   the more important parts of it, in the columns of their papers.

   highly valuable periodical, communicating much and various
   important information upon the subject of which it treats. It is
   the only publication of the kind in the country, is certainly a
   very much needed one, and ought, therefore, to be well sustained by
   the public.

   This periodical gives a large amount of information on Prison
   Discipline, and cannot fail to interest such as grieve over the
   sufferings occasioned by crime, and regard the imprisoned criminal
   as still belonging to our common humanity, and needing the
   commiseration of the wise and good.

<p>
   INTO THE ALLEGED TENDENCY OF THE SEPARATION OF CONVICTS, ONE FROM
   THE OTHER, TO PRODUCE DISEASE AND DERANGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
   <span class="smcap">By a Citizen of Pennsylvania.</span>
   <em>Philadelphia</em>: E. C. &amp; J. Biddle. 1849.
</p>
<p>
   It is, as might possibly be anticipated from the residence of the
   author, an elaborate and ardent defence of the separate system of
   confinement. The charge of its peculiar tendency to induce disease
   and insanity, is altogether denied, and the testimony of the
   successive physicians to the Eastern State Penitentiary, during a
   term of nearly twenty years, goes very satisfactorily to warrant
   the denial.
</p>
<p>
   The author is not, however, inclined to rest at this, but carries
   the war into the enemies’ camp. The chapter entitled Medical
   Practice, in a Congregate Prison, is calculated to attract
   attention, from the positions laid down in it, and their startling
   illustrations, deduced from the well known case of Abner Rogers.
   It is not the time or the place for us to enter on this warmly
   controverted subject, and we have noticed the work only on account
   of its bearing on the subject of insanity, and as forming a part
   of its literature.—<cite>Am. Journal of Insanity, published
   by the Superintendent of the New York Lunatic Asylum, July,
   1850.</cite>
</p>
<p>
   So far as the leading controversy, in regard to the rival systems
   of prison discipline, is concerned, it seems to us to cover
   the entire ground with singular ability.—<cite>Princeton
   Review.</cite>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
